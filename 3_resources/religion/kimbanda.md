## what is 'jogo de buzios'?

< Jogo de Búzios, also known as "Shell Divination" or "Cowrie Shell Divination," is a traditional form of divination that originated in West Africa and is widely practiced in Brazil and other parts of the Americas.

In Jogo de Búzios, a diviner or "babalawo" uses a set of cowrie shells or "búzios" to communicate with the spiritual world and provide guidance to the client. The shells are tossed or cast onto a mat, and the pattern in which they fall is interpreted based on a system of meanings associated with each shell and their positions.

The diviner may also call upon various deities or spirits from the African pantheon, such as Orishas, to assist in the reading. Jogo de Búzios is considered a complex and sophisticated form of divination that requires extensive training and experience to master. It is often used to provide insights into personal relationships, career, health, and other important aspects of life.

## list the religions that has this in their practice

< Jogo de Búzios is primarily associated with the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé, which originated in Brazil during the colonial period and incorporates elements of West and Central African religious traditions. However, it is also used in other African diasporic religions, such as Umbanda and Quimbanda, which are practiced in Brazil and other parts of Latin America.

Jogo de Búzios has its roots in the Yoruba religion of Nigeria, where it is known as Ifá. Ifá has spread throughout the African diaspora and is practiced in other parts of the Americas, such as Cuba, where it is known as Santería, and Trinidad and Tobago, where it is known as Orisha.

In addition, Jogo de Búzios has also been incorporated into some forms of esoteric and New Age spirituality, often in a syncretic manner with other religious traditions such as Christianity or Buddhism.

## detail how this practice relates to kimbanda and its pantheon

< Kimbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that originated in Brazil and combines elements of African traditional religions with Roman Catholicism and Indigenous beliefs. In Kimbanda, Jogo de Búzios is one of the primary methods of divination used to communicate with the spiritual world and gain guidance from the deities.

The pantheon of Kimbanda is complex and includes a variety of spirits and deities, many of whom are associated with specific aspects of nature or human experience. The primary deities in Kimbanda are known as Exus and Pomba Giras, who are associated with spiritual power and sexuality, respectively.

In Jogo de Búzios, the diviner or "pai de santo" (father of saints) will often call upon the spirits of Exus and Pomba Giras, as well as other deities from the Kimbanda pantheon, to assist in the reading. Each deity has a specific set of shells associated with them, and the diviner will interpret the pattern in which these shells fall to gain insight into the client's situation.

For example, one of the Exus associated with Jogo de Búzios is Exu Tranca Rua, who is considered the gatekeeper between the spiritual and physical worlds. The shells associated with Exu Tranca Rua are interpreted to provide guidance on matters related to protection, obstacles, and gatekeeping.

Overall, Jogo de Búzios is an important aspect of Kimbanda and is used to gain insight and guidance from the deities, as well as to deepen one's spiritual connection with the divine.

## talk about the etymology of 'cowrie shell divination'

< The term "Cowrie Shell Divination" refers to the use of cowrie shells in the practice of divination. The cowrie shell has been used as a form of currency, adornment, and spiritual symbol in many cultures throughout history, including in West Africa, where it is believed to have originated.

The word "cowrie" comes from the Tamil word "kauri," which means "shell." The Tamil people were one of the major seafaring communities of the ancient world and played a significant role in the global trade of cowrie shells. The shells were highly valued in many cultures for their beauty and durability, as well as for their association with the sea and the divine feminine.

The practice of cowrie shell divination is also known by other names in different cultures. In West Africa, it is known as "Ifa" or "Afa" divination, and in some parts of the Caribbean, it is known as "Obi" divination. However, the basic principles of divination using cowrie shells are similar across many cultures and involve interpreting the patterns and configurations of the shells to gain insight into the future or receive guidance from the divine.

In the context of Afro-Brazilian religions such as Candomblé and Kimbanda, cowrie shell divination is known as Jogo de Búzios. The word "búzios" is Portuguese for "shells," and reflects the influence of Portuguese colonization on the development of these religions in Brazil.

## which of the kimbanda deities are related to cowrie shell divination?

< In the Kimbanda religion, cowrie shell divination is commonly known as "Jogo de Búzios," and it is associated with the African deity of divination known as Orunmilá or Ifá. However, some Kimbanda practitioners may also use cowrie shells in divination practices associated with other deities, such as Exu, Pomba Gira, and Ogum.

In general, cowrie shells are considered powerful divinatory tools in many African religions and diasporic traditions. They are often used to communicate with the spirits and gain insights into personal and collective issues. In Kimbanda, cowrie shells are one of the most popular forms of divination, and they are typically used to answer questions related to love, health, career, and spiritual matters.

However, I can provide a general overview of the cowrie shell divination graph for Pombagiras as follows:
