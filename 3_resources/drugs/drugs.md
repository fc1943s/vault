## Edible Extraction

The difference in absorption between consuming cannabis in its whole plant form versus consuming pure extracts can have a significant impact on the effects of the drug.

When consuming cannabis in its whole plant form, the active compounds, such as THC and CBD, are absorbed along with a wide range of other compounds, including terpenes, flavonoids, and other cannabinoids. These additional compounds are thought to interact with the active compounds in a process known as the "entourage effect," which can modulate the effects of the drug.

The entourage effect refers to the phenomenon in which the various compounds present in the whole plant work together to enhance or modulate the effects of the active compounds. For example, terpenes are known to have a range of therapeutic effects and can modulate the effects of THC and CBD.

On the other hand, when consuming pure extracts, such as CBD oil or THC oil, the individual is only consuming the specific compound that the extract was made from, and thus not getting the benefit of the entourage effect.

Additionally, the method of consumption also plays a role in the absorption, when cannabis is smoked or vaporized, the active compounds are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, providing fast onset and short duration of effects, while when ingested, the active compounds are metabolized by the liver, providing slower onset but longer duration of effects.

Overall, the difference in absorption between consuming cannabis in its whole plant form versus consuming pure extracts can have a significant impact on the effects of the drug, and the entourage effect of the whole plant may provide a more therapeutic effect than consuming pure extracts. However, more research is needed to fully understand the difference in absorption and the effects of consuming cannabis in different forms.

About the entourage effect, terpenes are known to have sedative and anti-anxiety properties and can enhance the calming effects of THC when they work together. Similarly, CBD may reduce some of the adverse side effects associated with high levels of THC such as anxiety by working alongside it. Thus, consuming whole plant products that contain both active cannabinoids and other beneficial compounds like terpenes will result in more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts on their own due to this. A good example of this is full-spectrum CBD oil which contains a range of cannabinoids, terpenes and other beneficial compounds.

Edibles are another form of cannabis consumption, and they too are subject to the entourage effect. When consuming edibles, THC is metabolized by the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC which has a stronger psychoactive effect than regular THC when consumed in its natural form. Additionally, some terpenes have been shown to be more bioavailable when ingested as opposed to smoked or vaporized due to their lipid solubility; this could lead them interacting with cannabinoids differently resulting in different effects compared to smoking or vaping it.

The consumption for any individual will depend on their needs, preferences and the type of product being consumed. Ultimately though, consuming cannabis in its whole plant form is likely to provide more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts or edibles due to the entourage effect created by all of the compounds present. The method of this whole plant form consumption that preserves the entourage effect the best is likely to be vaporization, due to the high bioavailability and fast onset of effects, followed by usage of apparatus such as bongs or pipes. On bongs specifically, the water can help cool the smoke and make it easier to inhale, as well as filter out some of the potentially carcinogenic compounds.

In a scale of 0 to 100, the usage of water bongs, pipes, and vaporizers would get a score of 90. This is because it provides the best way to consume cannabis in its whole plant form while preserving all of the compounds present for maximum therapeutic benefit due to their entourage effect on each other. Edibles or pure extracts can provide more targeted effects but will lack some of this potential as they are missing out on these additional beneficial compounds that could be interacting with one another if consumed via smoking/vaping methods.

In the context of edible extract, the best cooking method to preserve the entourage effect of cannabis is to decarboxylate it before adding it into food or beverages. Decarboxylation refers to a process by which THCA (non-psychoactive form of THC) gets converted into THC, thus increasing its psychoactivity and bioavailability when consumed. It can be done either through heating in an oven or using microwave/stovetop method over low heat for extended periods. This will ensure that you are getting the maximum therapeutic benefit from consuming cannabis as all compounds present in whole plant products interact with one another resulting in more potent effects than pure extracts on their own.

Some tips about decarboxylation, is to ensure that the cannabis is heated evenly, and not over-heated as this could lead to some of the active compounds being destroyed. Additionally, it’s important to note that decarboxylation does not occur when consuming edibles directly without heating; for example eating raw flower or using tinctures/oils will not have any psychoactive effects because THCA has yet been converted into THC. Cases of overheating can also lead to degradation of cannabinoids and terpenes, so decarboxylating cannabis should be done with caution.

To summarize before the instructions, consuming cannabis in its whole plant form will result in more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts or edibles due to the entourage effect created by all of the compounds present. The best way to preserve this is through vaporization followed by usage of apparatus such as bongs or pipes; however when creating edibles it’s important that they are first heated via a process known as decarboxylation which converts THCA into THC for maximum potency and bioavailability.

Decarboxylation techniques using butter, oil, or alcohol-based tinctures can help preserve the entourage effect and allow for more potent edibles. Considering that it’s important to not overheat cannabis as this could lead to degradation of some cannabinoids and terpenes, the best cooking method to preserve the entourage effect is:

1. Preheat oven to 250-300°F (120-150°C).
2. Spread cannabis flower or concentrate onto a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes so that it’s heated evenly throughout.
3. After decarboxylation process is complete, add cannabis into your recipe as desired; make sure not to overheat further while cooking edibles otherwise some of the active compounds may be destroyed in this step too!

## list a full sous vide routine, sorted by applications

< Sure, here is a full sous vide routine for decarboxylating cannabis sorted by applications:

Decarboxylation for Edibles:
Preheat a water bath to 203°F (95°C) using a sous vide machine.
Grind your cannabis to a fine consistency and place it in a vacuum-sealed bag or heat-safe container with a lid.
Seal the bag or container using a vacuum sealer or a zip-top bag with the air removed.
Submerge the bag or container in the water bath and allow it to cook for 1-2 hours, depending on the desired level of decarboxylation.
After cooking, remove the bag or container from the water bath and allow it to cool to room temperature before opening.
Decarboxylation for Smoking or Vaporizing:
Preheat a water bath to 185°F (85°C) using a sous vide machine.
Grind your cannabis to a fine consistency and place it in a vacuum-sealed bag or heat-safe container with a lid.
Seal the bag or container using a vacuum sealer or a zip-top bag with the air removed.
Submerge the bag or container in the water bath and allow it to cook for 1 hour.
After cooking, remove the bag or container from the water bath and allow it to cool to room temperature before opening.
It's important to note that these cooking times are general guidelines, and the optimal cooking time may vary based on the specific strain and quality of cannabis being used. It's also recommended to experiment with different cooking times and temperatures to find what works best for your needs.

## could cannabis actually help north korea's economy instead? detail how with academic rigor

< There is some evidence to suggest that legalizing and regulating the production and sale of cannabis could have economic benefits, particularly in terms of generating tax revenue and creating jobs. However, it's important to note that the potential economic benefits of cannabis legalization are complex and context-dependent, and would depend on a range of factors including regulatory frameworks, market conditions, and cultural attitudes towards cannabis.

One potential benefit of legalizing cannabis in North Korea could be the creation of a new legal industry that could potentially generate tax revenue and create jobs. The global legal cannabis industry is expected to be worth billions of dollars in the coming years, and countries that have legalized cannabis have seen significant economic benefits. For example, in Canada, the legalization of cannabis in 2018 is estimated to have generated over $186 million in tax revenue in the first year alone, and has created tens of thousands of new jobs.

In addition to creating new economic opportunities, the legalization of cannabis could also help to reduce the costs associated with enforcing prohibition. In many countries, including North Korea, the costs of enforcing drug laws are significant, and legalizing cannabis could help to reduce these costs and redirect resources towards other priorities.

However, it's important to note that the potential economic benefits of legalizing cannabis in North Korea would need to be balanced against potential risks and challenges, including concerns around public health, social justice, and the potential for organized crime to exploit the legal market.

Overall, while there is some evidence to suggest that legalizing cannabis could have economic benefits, any decision to do so would need to be based on a careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits, and would need to be implemented in a carefully regulated and culturally sensitive manner. More research is needed to fully understand the economic implications of cannabis legalization in North Korea.

Harvest time will depend on the specific strain being grown and can vary based on the weather conditions during the growing season.

## considering all north korean cities, which 3 cities have the better weather to plant these 3 strains?

< As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time or historical weather data for specific North Korean cities. However, based on the general climate of North Korea, some cities may be better suited for outdoor cannabis cultivation than others.

Here are three North Korean cities that may have weather conditions conducive to growing the three strains mentioned earlier:

Pyongyang: The capital city of North Korea has a humid continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. While temperatures can range from -10°C in the winter to 30°C in the summer, the city typically experiences mild temperatures during the spring and fall. This could make it a suitable location for growing the Durban Poison and Afghan Kush strains, which require longer growing seasons.

Chongjin: Located in the northeastern part of North Korea, Chongjin has a similar climate to Pyongyang, with cold winters and warm summers. The city receives most of its rainfall between June and August, which could be a factor to consider when planting cannabis. Early Skunk, which is known for its resistance to cold weather and pests, could be a suitable strain to grow in Chongjin.

Wonsan: This coastal city in eastern North Korea has a humid subtropical climate, with mild winters and hot summers. The city receives moderate rainfall throughout the year, which could be beneficial for outdoor cannabis cultivation. Blue Dream, a popular hybrid strain, could be a suitable strain to grow in Wonsan due to its moderate flowering time and balanced effects.

It's important to note that the weather conditions in each city can vary depending on the time of year, and that local laws and regulations around cannabis cultivation and use should always be followed. Additionally, any decision to grow cannabis should be made with caution and consideration for the potential risks and benefits, as well as the cultural and political context in which cannabis is being grown.

## this country's weather seems kinda grim. can north korea really profit from cannabis considering this climate window?

< North Korea's climate can present challenges for outdoor cannabis cultivation, as the country experiences cold winters and hot summers with distinct four seasons. The monsoon season occurs from June to September, with heavy rainfall and occasional typhoons. These weather conditions can make it difficult to grow certain strains of cannabis and could impact overall yields.

However, it's important to note that cannabis can be grown in a variety of different environments, including indoor and greenhouse settings. Indoor cultivation, while more expensive in terms of setup and energy usage, allows for greater control over environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light. Greenhouse cultivation can provide a balance between indoor and outdoor cultivation, offering some environmental control while still utilizing natural sunlight.

In addition, there is a growing global demand for cannabis and cannabis-derived products, which could provide an economic opportunity for North Korea. The global legal cannabis market is projected to be worth billions of dollars in the coming years, and countries that have legalized cannabis have seen significant economic benefits.

However, any decision to pursue cannabis cultivation in North Korea would need to be made carefully and with consideration for local laws and regulations, as well as the potential risks and benefits associated with cannabis cultivation. Additionally, North Korea's political and cultural context would need to be taken into account, as attitudes towards cannabis may vary across different regions and communities.

## how mt paektu's energy could be used in large scale indoor production with appropriate investment?

< Mount Paektu, which is a volcanic mountain on the border between North Korea and China, is believed to be a sacred site in Korean culture and is revered as the birthplace of the Korean people. While it's unclear exactly how the energy from Mount Paektu could be harnessed for indoor cannabis cultivation, there are a few possibilities to consider.

One option could be to utilize geothermal energy, which is heat that is generated by the Earth's core and can be accessed through underground wells or reservoirs. Geothermal energy is considered to be a clean and sustainable source of energy, as it does not produce greenhouse gases or other harmful emissions. In North Korea, there are several hot springs and geothermal fields located near Mount Paektu, which could potentially be used to power indoor cannabis cultivation facilities.

Another option could be to utilize hydroelectric power, which is generated by moving water. North Korea has several large rivers and waterways, including the Yalu River, which flows along the border with China near Mount Paektu. Hydroelectric power is considered to be a renewable and environmentally friendly source of energy, and could potentially be used to power indoor cannabis cultivation facilities.

However, it's important to note that implementing large-scale indoor cannabis cultivation facilities would require significant investment in infrastructure and technology. This would likely involve the construction of specialized indoor growing facilities, as well as the installation of equipment such as lighting, climate control systems, and irrigation systems. Additionally, any decision to pursue cannabis cultivation in North Korea would need to be made carefully and with consideration for local laws and regulations, as well as the potential risks and benefits associated with cannabis cultivation.

## rating 0-1000, compare the quality of hashish that could be extracted using ethanol 95% compared to all extraction methods available including vacuumed gases and ice buckets

< It is challenging to provide an exact numerical rating for the quality of hashish extracted using 95% ethanol compared to other extraction methods, as the quality can vary based on various factors, such as the expertise of the extractor, the quality of the starting material, and the specific techniques employed.

However, I can provide a general comparison of ethanol extraction with other popular extraction methods:

Ethanol extraction (95% ethanol): Ethanol is a popular solvent for extracting cannabinoids and terpenes due to its safety, affordability, and ease of use. The purity and quality of the extract can be quite high, but ethanol might also extract unwanted compounds like chlorophyll, which can affect the taste and color of the final product. Moreover, 95% ethanol may not be as effective as higher concentrations (like 99% or 99.9%) in producing a cleaner extract.

Butane Hash Oil (BHO) extraction: BHO extraction uses butane as a solvent and can yield a high-quality concentrate with excellent potency and flavor. However, this method can be dangerous due to the flammability of butane, and improper extraction can result in harmful residual solvents in the final product.

CO2 extraction: This method uses supercritical or subcritical carbon dioxide to extract cannabinoids and terpenes. CO2 extraction can yield a clean, high-quality concentrate with minimal risk of residual solvents. However, this method typically requires expensive equipment and expertise, making it less accessible for small-scale or home producers.

Ice water extraction (bubble hash): This method involves agitating cannabis in ice water to separate the trichomes, which are then collected through a series of fine mesh screens. Bubble hash can be of high quality, but the potency may not be as high as other methods like BHO or CO2 extraction. This method is often considered more "natural" as it does not involve the use of solvents.

Dry sift (kief): This method involves using fine screens to mechanically separate the trichomes from the plant material. While dry sift can produce a high-quality concentrate, the purity and potency are typically lower than solvent-based extraction methods.

Rosin: Rosin is a solventless extraction method that uses heat and pressure to extract cannabinoids and terpenes. The quality of rosin can be quite high, with a full-spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes preserved. However, the yield may be lower compared to solvent-based extractions.

Considering the factors mentioned above, it's difficult to assign a specific rating to ethanol extraction compared to other methods. However, each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of the method often depends on the desired outcome, available equipment, and expertise.

## considering rosin, detail how low yields are while listing what can be done with the rest

< Rosin is a popular solventless extraction method that uses heat and pressure to extract cannabinoids and terpenes from cannabis. The yields for rosin extraction can be lower than some solvent-based methods, depending on various factors such as the quality and freshness of the starting material, temperature, pressure, and pressing time. Yields for rosin typically range from 10% to 25%, but this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.

Here are some ways to increase rosin yields and utilize the remaining cannabis material after extraction:

Optimize pressing conditions: Experiment with different temperatures, pressure settings, and pressing times to find the optimal conditions that yield the best results for your specific material. Generally, higher pressure and lower temperatures preserve more terpenes, while higher temperatures may increase yield at the cost of losing some terpenes.

Quality of starting material: The quality of the cannabis material used for extraction can significantly impact the yield. Using fresh, properly cured buds with high trichome density can result in higher yields. Sifted kief or bubble hash can also be pressed to obtain rosin with potentially higher yields.

Pre-pressing: Some extractors use a pre-press mold to compact the cannabis material into a uniform shape before pressing. This can help improve yields by ensuring even pressure distribution and making it easier for the rosin to flow out of the material.

Use of micron bags or screens: Using micron bags or screens can help filter out plant material during the extraction process, potentially increasing the purity and yield of the rosin.

Multiple presses: Performing a second or third press on the same cannabis material can sometimes yield additional rosin. However, the quality of the rosin from subsequent presses may be lower.

As for the remaining cannabis material after rosin extraction, often called "rosin chips" or "pucks," there are several ways to utilize it:

Edibles: Rosin chips can be used to create cannabis-infused butter or oil for use in edibles. While most of the cannabinoids have been extracted during the pressing process, there will still be some residual cannabinoids present in the material.

Tinctures: The leftover material can be used to create tinctures by soaking it in high-proof alcohol or glycerin. This will extract any remaining cannabinoids and create a liquid that can be used sublingually or added to food and beverages.

Topicals: Infuse rosin chips into a carrier oil or base cream to create cannabis-infused topicals, such as balms, salves, or lotions.

Smoking or vaping: Although the remaining material will have a lower potency than the original cannabis, it can still be smoked or vaporized if desired. However, the flavor and potency may not be as enjoyable as fresh cannabis.

Remember that when using rosin chips for edibles, tinctures, or topicals, it's essential to decarboxylate the material first to convert the remaining THCA into psychoactive THC. This can be done by heating the material in an oven at around 240°F (115°C) for 30-45 minutes.
