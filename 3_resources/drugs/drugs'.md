## Edible Extraction

The difference in absorption between consuming cannabis in its whole plant form versus consuming pure extracts can have a significant impact on the effects of the drug.

When consuming cannabis in its whole plant form, the active compounds, such as THC and CBD, are absorbed along with a wide range of other compounds, including terpenes, flavonoids, and other cannabinoids. These additional compounds are thought to interact with the active compounds in a process known as the "entourage effect," which can modulate the effects of the drug.

The entourage effect refers to the phenomenon in which the various compounds present in the whole plant work together to enhance or modulate the effects of the active compounds. For example, terpenes are known to have a range of therapeutic effects and can modulate the effects of THC and CBD.

On the other hand, when consuming pure extracts, such as CBD oil or THC oil, the individual is only consuming the specific compound that the extract was made from, and thus not getting the benefit of the entourage effect.

Additionally, the method of consumption also plays a role in the absorption, when cannabis is smoked or vaporized, the active compounds are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, providing fast onset and short duration of effects, while when ingested, the active compounds are metabolized by the liver, providing slower onset but longer duration of effects.

Overall, the difference in absorption between consuming cannabis in its whole plant form versus consuming pure extracts can have a significant impact on the effects of the drug, and the entourage effect of the whole plant may provide a more therapeutic effect than consuming pure extracts. However, more research is needed to fully understand the difference in absorption and the effects of consuming cannabis in different forms.

About the entourage effect, terpenes are known to have sedative and anti-anxiety properties and can enhance the calming effects of THC when they work together. Similarly, CBD may reduce some of the adverse side effects associated with high levels of THC such as anxiety by working alongside it. Thus, consuming whole plant products that contain both active cannabinoids and other beneficial compounds like terpenes will result in more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts on their own due to this. A good example of this is full-spectrum CBD oil which contains a range of cannabinoids, terpenes and other beneficial compounds.

Edibles are another form of cannabis consumption, and they too are subject to the entourage effect. When consuming edibles, THC is metabolized by the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC which has a stronger psychoactive effect than regular THC when consumed in its natural form. Additionally, some terpenes have been shown to be more bioavailable when ingested as opposed to smoked or vaporized due to their lipid solubility; this could lead them interacting with cannabinoids differently resulting in different effects compared to smoking or vaping it.

The consumption for any individual will depend on their needs, preferences and the type of product being consumed. Ultimately though, consuming cannabis in its whole plant form is likely to provide more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts or edibles due to the entourage effect created by all of the compounds present. The method of this whole plant form consumption that preserves the entourage effect the best is likely to be vaporization, due to the high bioavailability and fast onset of effects, followed by usage of apparatus such as bongs or pipes. On bongs specifically, the water can help cool the smoke and make it easier to inhale, as well as filter out some of the potentially carcinogenic compounds.

In a scale of 0 to 100, the usage of water bongs, pipes, and vaporizers would get a score of 90. This is because it provides the best way to consume cannabis in its whole plant form while preserving all of the compounds present for maximum therapeutic benefit due to their entourage effect on each other. Edibles or pure extracts can provide more targeted effects but will lack some of this potential as they are missing out on these additional beneficial compounds that could be interacting with one another if consumed via smoking/vaping methods.

In the context of edible extract, the best cooking method to preserve the entourage effect of cannabis is to decarboxylate it before adding it into food or beverages. Decarboxylation refers to a process by which THCA (non-psychoactive form of THC) gets converted into THC, thus increasing its psychoactivity and bioavailability when consumed. It can be done either through heating in an oven or using microwave/stovetop method over low heat for extended periods. This will ensure that you are getting the maximum therapeutic benefit from consuming cannabis as all compounds present in whole plant products interact with one another resulting in more potent effects than pure extracts on their own.

Some tips about decarboxylation, is to ensure that the cannabis is heated evenly, and not over-heated as this could lead to some of the active compounds being destroyed. Additionally, it’s important to note that decarboxylation does not occur when consuming edibles directly without heating; for example eating raw flower or using tinctures/oils will not have any psychoactive effects because THCA has yet been converted into THC. Cases of overheating can also lead to degradation of cannabinoids and terpenes, so decarboxylating cannabis should be done with caution.

To summarize before the instructions, consuming cannabis in its whole plant form will result in more therapeutic benefits than pure extracts or edibles due to the entourage effect created by all of the compounds present. The best way to preserve this is through vaporization followed by usage of apparatus such as bongs or pipes; however when creating edibles it’s important that they are first heated via a process known as decarboxylation which converts THCA into THC for maximum potency and bioavailability.

Decarboxylation techniques using butter, oil, or alcohol-based tinctures can help preserve the entourage effect and allow for more potent edibles. Considering that it’s important to not overheat cannabis as this could lead to degradation of some cannabinoids and terpenes, the best cooking method to preserve the entourage effect is:

1. Preheat oven to 250-300°F (120-150°C).
2. Spread cannabis flower or concentrate onto a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes so that it’s heated evenly throughout.
3. After decarboxylation process is complete, add cannabis into your recipe as desired; make sure not to overheat further while cooking edibles otherwise some of the active compounds may be destroyed in this step too!

## list a full sous vide routine, sorted by applications

< Sure, here is a full sous vide routine for decarboxylating cannabis sorted by applications:

Decarboxylation for Edibles:
Preheat a water bath to 203°F (95°C) using a sous vide machine.
Grind your cannabis to a fine consistency and place it in a vacuum-sealed bag or heat-safe container with a lid.
Seal the bag or container using a vacuum sealer or a zip-top bag with the air removed.
Submerge the bag or container in the water bath and allow it to cook for 1-2 hours, depending on the desired level of decarboxylation.
After cooking, remove the bag or container from the water bath and allow it to cool to room temperature before opening.
Decarboxylation for Smoking or Vaporizing:
Preheat a water bath to 185°F (85°C) using a sous vide machine.
Grind your cannabis to a fine consistency and place it in a vacuum-sealed bag or heat-safe container with a lid.
Seal the bag or container using a vacuum sealer or a zip-top bag with the air removed.
Submerge the bag or container in the water bath and allow it to cook for 1 hour.
After cooking, remove the bag or container from the water bath and allow it to cool to room temperature before opening.
It's important to note that these cooking times are general guidelines, and the optimal cooking time may vary based on the specific strain and quality of cannabis being used. It's also recommended to experiment with different cooking times and temperatures to find what works best for your needs.
