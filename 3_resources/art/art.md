## list the top 5 tools available today to recreate images using AI without login (dall e 2 was tested and still suboptimal)

< As an AI language model, I cannot authenticate to third-party tools nor perform exhaustive tests on their efficacy. However, I can list some popular AI-powered image generation tools that are publicly available and do not require login. Here are five such tools:

Artbreeder: Artbreeder is a web-based tool that uses AI to generate and manipulate images. It allows users to create new images by combining and evolving existing ones, and provides a wide range of controls for adjusting the style, color, and shape of the images.

Deep Dream Generator: Deep Dream Generator is another web-based tool that uses neural networks to generate and manipulate images. It allows users to upload their own images and apply various styles and effects, including psychedelic and surrealistic patterns.

GANBreeder: GANBreeder is a tool that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images by evolving and crossbreeding existing ones. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to explore the space of possible images.

Let's Enhance: Let's Enhance is an online tool that uses AI to enhance the quality and resolution of images. It allows users to upload their own images and choose from a range of enhancement options, such as upscaling, denoising, and color correction.

NeuralStyler: NeuralStyler is a tool that uses neural networks to apply artistic styles to images. It allows users to upload their own images and choose from a variety of styles inspired by famous artists, such as Van Gogh, Picasso, and Munch.

It's important to note that the effectiveness and quality of these tools may vary depending on the input image and the desired output. Users should carefully evaluate and compare the results of different tools to choose the best option for their specific needs.

## compare after effects, lightroom, premiere and photoshop (2023 and more)

< After Effects, Lightroom, Premiere, and Photoshop are all powerful software tools designed for creative professionals. While they share some similarities, they each have unique features and capabilities that make them well-suited for different tasks.

After Effects is a motion graphics and visual effects software that is used for creating animations, compositing footage, and adding visual effects to video. It has a vast array of tools for keyframe animation, tracking, and 3D rendering, making it a popular choice for animators and motion graphics designers.

Lightroom is a photo editing software that is primarily used for organizing, editing, and processing digital photos. It has a wide range of tools for adjusting exposure, color balance, contrast, and other aspects of a photo's appearance. It also has features for managing and organizing large photo libraries, making it a great choice for photographers.

Premiere is a video editing software that is designed for professional video editing. It allows for seamless integration between video and audio editing, as well as advanced features for color correction, audio mixing, and visual effects. It is a popular choice for filmmakers, video editors, and content creators.

Photoshop is an image editing software that is widely used for editing and manipulating digital images. It has a vast array of tools for retouching photos, creating digital art, and designing graphics. It is often used by graphic designers, digital artists, and photographers.

In summary, each of these software tools is designed for a specific purpose, and choosing the right one will depend on your specific needs as a creative professional. After Effects is best for motion graphics and visual effects, Lightroom for photo editing and organization, Premiere for professional video editing, and Photoshop for digital image editing and graphic design.

## make the difference clear between premiere pro and after effects, depicting examples of what cant be achieved on the other

< While Premiere Pro and After Effects are both Adobe software tools used for video editing, they have different capabilities and are better suited for different tasks.

Premiere Pro is a non-linear video editing software that is primarily used for assembling and editing video footage, adding audio tracks, and creating video sequences. It has features such as trimming, cutting, and adding transitions to video clips, and is widely used for editing documentaries, films, and other types of video content.

After Effects, on the other hand, is a motion graphics and visual effects software that is used for creating animations, compositing footage, and adding visual effects to video. It has a vast array of tools for keyframe animation, tracking, and 3D rendering, making it a popular choice for animators and motion graphics designers.

Here are some examples of tasks that are best suited for one software tool over the other:

Compositing: After Effects is designed for creating complex composites by layering multiple elements and applying visual effects. It can be used to create green screen effects, motion graphics, and add special effects such as explosions or fire. Premiere Pro has some compositing tools, but it is not as comprehensive as After Effects.

Motion Graphics: After Effects is the better tool for creating complex motion graphics that require keyframe animation, tracking, and 3D rendering. Premiere Pro has some limited motion graphics capabilities, but it is not as robust as After Effects.

Color Correction: Premiere Pro is designed for professional color correction and grading, including features such as Lumetri Color controls, which allow you to adjust color balance, saturation, and contrast. While After Effects does have some color correction tools, it is not as comprehensive as Premiere Pro.

Audio Editing: While both Premiere Pro and After Effects have audio editing capabilities, Premiere Pro is better suited for audio editing tasks such as noise reduction, audio leveling, and audio mixing.

In summary, Premiere Pro is better suited for editing and assembling video footage, while After Effects is designed for creating motion graphics and visual effects. While both software tools have some overlapping capabilities, they are better suited for different tasks and are often used together to create professional video content.

## premiere is more like ableton, after effects is more like flash?

< While there are some similarities between Premiere Pro and Ableton Live, and between After Effects and Adobe Flash, it is important to note that each software tool has unique features and capabilities that make them distinct.

Premiere Pro is primarily used for non-linear video editing, and has a timeline-based interface that allows you to assemble and edit video clips, add transitions and effects, and mix audio tracks. Ableton Live, on the other hand, is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that is designed for music production and live performance, and has a session view that allows you to arrange and manipulate audio clips in a nonlinear way.

After Effects is a motion graphics and visual effects software that is used for creating animations, compositing footage, and adding visual effects to video. It has a powerful animation system with keyframe controls, and allows you to work with 2D and 3D layers to create complex motion graphics. Adobe Flash, on the other hand, is a multimedia software platform that was used for creating animations, interactive websites, and mobile applications. While Flash has some animation capabilities, it is not as comprehensive as After Effects.

In summary, while there are some similarities between Premiere Pro and Ableton Live, and between After Effects and Adobe Flash, each software tool has unique features and capabilities that make them well-suited for different tasks. Premiere Pro is best for non-linear video editing, Ableton Live for music production and live performance, After Effects for motion graphics and visual effects, and Adobe Flash (now obsolete) was used for creating interactive web content.
