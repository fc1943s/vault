## give academic examples of terms/definitions and admonitions

< Sure, here are some examples of how academic writers might use definition lists and admonitions in their writing:

Definition lists:

Asymptote
: A straight line that a curve approaches as it tends towards infinity.

Catalysis
: The acceleration or retardation of a chemical reaction by a substance that is not consumed in the reaction.

Metaphor
: A figure of speech that describes a subject by comparing it to something else that is seemingly unrelated.
In academic writing, definition lists can be used to define key terms or concepts that may be unfamiliar to readers. This can help to clarify the meaning of technical or specialized vocabulary.

Admonitions:

::: tip
When conducting research, be sure to consider the potential biases of your sources.

::: note
The discussion section of a research paper should synthesize the findings and offer interpretations of the results.

::: warning
Be sure to properly cite any sources that you use in your writing, to avoid plagiarism.
In academic writing, admonitions can be used to call attention to key points or issues that are relevant to the topic being discussed. This can help to emphasize the importance of certain ideas or concepts, or to warn readers of potential pitfalls or errors. Admonitions can be particularly useful in providing guidance to students or others who may be less familiar with the academic writing process.
