Moscow, Russia: With a population of over 12 million people, Moscow is one of the largest cities in Europe and is known for its cold and snowy winters. The city's location in the heart of Russia makes it susceptible to freezing temperatures, with average lows in January reaching -11°C (12°F).
Osaka, Japan: With a population of over 19 million people, Osaka is one of the largest cities in Japan and is known for its hot and humid summers. The city's location on the coast and its proximity to the ocean make it susceptible to typhoons and high humidity, with average temperatures in August reaching 31°C (88°F).
Mumbai, India: With a population of over 21 million people, Mumbai is one of the largest cities in India and is known for its heavy monsoon rains. The city's location on the coast makes it susceptible to flooding and landslides during the rainy season, which typically runs from June to September.
