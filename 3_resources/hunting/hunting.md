Prensa de arco: É utilizada para comprimir com segurança as lâminas do arco, permitindo trabalhar nos cabos e no sistema de roldanas.

Esquadro de arco: Uma ferramenta em forma de T utilizada para medir e alinhar o ponto de encaixe e a altura da empunhadura do arco.

Paquímetro e micrômetro: São usados para tirar medidas precisas dos componentes do arco, como o sistema de roldanas, o comprimento de eixo a eixo e a espessura das lâminas.

Serra de fita ou tico-tico: Será necessário para cortar o material do punho (riser) e das lâminas na forma desejada.

Lixadeira de cinta e/ou lixadeira de disco: São utilizadas para refinar o formato do punho e das lâminas, além de alisar suas superfícies.

Limas e grosas: Essas ferramentas são usadas para refinar ainda mais o formato e os contornos do punho e dos membros, especialmente em áreas de difícil acesso com uma lixadeira.

Furadeira de bancada: Uma furadeira de bancada é essencial para perfurar furos precisos no punho para montagem de hardware, bem como furos nos membros para o eixo.

Jogo de machos e cossinetes: Isso é necessário para enfiar os furos para parafusos e outros hardwares.

Jogo de chaves Allen: Você precisará disso para apertar e ajustar vários parafusos, parafusos e outros hardwares usados na montagem do arco composto.

Kit de encordoamento de arco: Este kit geralmente inclui um gabarito de encordoamento, linha de encordoamento e uma ferramenta de encordoamento, todos usados para aplicar uma camada protetora à corda do arco e criar laços para fixá-la ao arco.

Cera para corda de arco: Isso é usado para manter e proteger a corda do arco, prolongando sua vida útil.

Alicates de encaixe: Esses alicates são projetados para ajudá-lo a instalar pontos de encaixe na corda do arco com precisão e facilidade.

Separador de corda: Esta ferramenta é útil para separar as fibras da corda do arco ao servir ou instalar acessórios como miras peep.

Gabarito de corda de arco: Um gabarito de corda de arco é necessário para fazer suas próprias cordas de arco com o comprimento correto e com a tensão adequada.

Adesivos: Você precisará de adesivos fortes, como epóxi ou cianoacrilato, para colar vários componentes do arco, como pontas dos membros e hardware de montagem.

Grampos: Grampos são essenciais para segurar as peças juntas enquanto o adesivo cura ou para fixar o arco durante várias etapas do processo de construção.

Equipamentos de segurança: Óculos de segurança, luvas e uma máscara contra poeira são essenciais para proteger-se durante o processo de fabricação.

## now for every component that will go in the compound bow, list its dimensions using the metric system

< It's important to note that the dimensions of a compound bow's components can vary significantly based on factors such as the desired draw weight, draw length, and overall size of the bow. However, here are some general dimensions for a typical compound bow:

Riser (handle):
Length: 40-60 cm
Thickness: 2-4 cm
Width: 3-6 cm

Limbs:
Length: 35-50 cm
Width: 4-6 cm
Thickness: 1-3 cm
Cams:
Diameter: 6-12 cm

Axle-to-axle length (distance between the centers of the top and bottom cams): 75-105 cm

Bowstring:
Length: This will vary depending on the bow's axle-to-axle length and cam system. Measure the bow from the top cam groove to the bottom cam groove and add 2-3 cm for serving and loops.

Cables:
Length: The cables' length will vary based on the specific cam system used.
Consult the cam system manufacturer's recommendations for the appropriate cable length.

Brace height (distance from the riser to the bowstring):
Range: 18-22 cm

Nocking point:
Position on the bowstring: Typically, the nocking point is set 0.6-1.3 cm above the square, which is the point where the bowstring meets the arrow rest when the bow is in the braced position. This exact position may vary depending on the individual archer's form and preferences.

Peep sight:
Diameter: 3-6 mm
Position on the bowstring: The peep sight should be installed at a distance from the nocking point that aligns with the archer's line of sight when the bow is at full draw. This distance will vary depending on the individual archer's draw length and anchor point.

Arrow rest:
Position on the riser: The arrow rest should be mounted on the riser
approximately 2-3 cm above the shelf (the flat area where the arrow rests).

Stabilizer:
Length: 20-30 cm (stabilizer length can vary depending on the archer's preference and the specific discipline)
Diameter: 2-4 cm

Bow sling:
Length: Adjustable to fit the archer's hand and wrist comfortably.

Please note that these dimensions are general guidelines for a typical compound bow, and they may need to be adjusted to fit the specific requirements of the individual archer or the intended use of the bow. To ensure the best performance, it's recommended to consult with an experienced bow maker or archery coach to determine the ideal dimensions for your specific compound bow.

Componente | Especificação
-----------|--------------
Riser (empunhadura) | Comprimento: 40-60 cm Largura: 3-6 cm Espessura: 2-4 cm
Braços | Comprimento: 35-50 cm Largura: 4-6 cm Espessura: 1-3 cm
Cams | Diâmetro: 6-12 cm
Distância entre eixos (distância entre os centros dos cams superior e inferior) | 75-105 cm
Corda da besta | Comprimento: Isso varia dependendo da distância entre eixos da besta e do sistema de came. Meça a besta da ranhura do came superior até a ranhura do came inferior e adicione 2-3 cm para serviço e alças.
Cabos | Comprimento: O comprimento dos cabos varia com base no sistema de came específico usado. Consulte as recomendações do fabricante do sistema de came para o comprimento do cabo apropriado.
Altura do brace (distância da empunhadura à corda da besta) | Faixa: 18-22 cm
Ponto de encaixe (posição na corda da besta) | Tipicamente, o ponto de encaixe é definido a 0,6-1,3 cm acima do quadrado, que é o ponto onde a corda da besta encontra o suporte de flecha quando a besta está na posição de brace. Esta posição exata pode variar dependendo da forma e preferências individuais do arqueiro.
Miradouro (peep sight) | Diâmetro: 3-6 mm Posição na corda da besta: O miradouro deve ser instalado a uma distância do ponto de encaixe que se alinha com a linha de visão do arqueiro quando a besta está totalmente puxada. Essa distância varia dependendo do comprimento de puxada e ponto de ancoragem do arqueiro.
Suporte de flecha | Posição na empunhadura: O suporte de flecha deve ser montado na empunhadura, aproximadamente 2-3 cm acima da prateleira (a área plana onde a flecha repousa).
Estabilizador | Comprimento: 20-30 cm (o comprimento do estabilizador pode variar dependendo da preferência do arqueiro e da disciplina específica) Diâmetro: 2-4 cm
Alça da besta | Comprimento: Ajustável para caber confortavelmente na mão e no pulso do arqueiro.
