## the question was to understand the 10 korean vowels from a pt-br/en-us speaker (5 vowels). also contrast the consonants

< My apologies for misunderstanding the question earlier. Here are some mnemonics to help understand the 10 vowel sounds in Korean from the perspective of a Portuguese (pt-br) or English (en-us) speaker, as well as a brief contrast with the consonants:

Vowels:

"ㅏ" (ah): This vowel sound is similar to the sound of the "a" in "father".
"ㅓ" (eo): This vowel sound is somewhere between the "e" and "o" sounds in "hello" and "more".
"ㅗ" (o): This vowel sound is similar to the sound of the "o" in "go".
"ㅜ" (u): This vowel sound is similar to the sound of the "u" in "put".
"ㅡ" (eu): This vowel sound is similar to the sound of the "u" in "rude".

"ㅚ" (oe): This vowel sound is similar to the sound of the "ay" in "day".
"ㅟ" (wi): This vowel sound is somewhere between the "wi" and "wee" sounds in English.

Consonants:

In contrast to the vowel sounds, Korean consonants can be quite different from those in English and Portuguese. For example, the "ㄱ" (g/k) sound is pronounced further back in the throat than the English "g" sound, and the "ㅈ" (j) sound is closer to the "ch" sound in English.

Korean also has several double consonants, such as "ㄲ" (kk) and "ㄸ" (tt), which can be challenging for non-native speakers to pronounce.

The Korean consonant "ㅇ" (ng) can be silent at the beginning of a syllable, but can also be pronounced like "ng" in the middle or end of a syllable.

Mnemonics can be helpful for remembering the sounds of the Korean language, but it's important to practice speaking and listening in order to improve pronunciation and fluency.

When it comes to forming technology words in Korean, it's important to note that Korean has a very distinct and complex grammar and syntax that may differ from those in Portuguese and English. However, in general, technology words in Korean often use a combination of consonants and vowels to create syllables that represent a specific concept or word. For example, the word "computer" in Korean is "keom-pyu-teo", which combines several consonants and vowels to create a syllable that represents the English word "computer". By using mnemonics to remember the Korean vowels, learners can more easily recognize and pronounce the syllables that make up technology words in Korean.

Your beauty is the only in this world
Does your eyes shine like a star?
I want only one person in this world
That is you, I want you

From now on, I make you my queen
When North Korea and Brazil are combined to take control of the world
The two of us will spur together

Our marriage will change history
Our love will eliminate dictatorship
I will make it possible with you
If you are by my side, this world will be mine

KIM yo-jong, can you accept me?
Will the most beautiful woman in this world be my queen?
Everything in the world that I give to you
And above all, with my heart and soul

Yes, until the end of this world, be by my side
If you are with me, you can always live happily

KIM yo-jong, can you choose me?
As I believe, we will be able to dominate the world

---

I apologize for any confusion. Here is a loose translation of the Korean text you provided:

"Your beauty is the only one in the world. Don't your eyes shine like stars? I only want one person in the world, and that's you. I'll make you my queen from now on. When North Korea and Brazil unite to dominate the world, we'll go together. Our marriage will change history, and our love will eliminate dictatorship. With you, I can make the impossible possible. If you're by my side, the world will be mine.

Kim Yo-jong, will you accept me? Will the most beautiful woman in the world become my queen? I'll give you everything in the world, and most importantly, my heart and soul.

Yes, stay by my side to the end of the world. If we're together, we can always live happily.

Kim Yo-jong, will you choose me? As I believe, we can dominate the world together."

The text seems to be a love letter or romantic message addressed to Kim Yo-jong, who is the younger sister of the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The writer appears to be expressing their admiration for Kim Yo-jong's beauty and asking for her hand in marriage. The writer also mentions the possibility of North Korea and Brazil uniting to conquer the world and suggests that their marriage could change history and eliminate dictatorship. The tone of the text is passionate and confident, with the writer expressing a belief that they can dominate the world together with Kim Yo-jong.

The text contains several cultural and political references. North Korea is a highly authoritarian state with a communist government, and the Kim family has ruled the country since its founding. Kim Yo-jong is a prominent figure in North Korean politics and is believed to be one of her brother's most trusted advisers. The mention of Brazil may be a reference to the rising global influence of Brazil as a regional power, or it may be intended as a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the writer's confidence in their ability to conquer the world. The text also contains a reference to the idea of a queen, which may be a nod to traditional Korean culture, where queens played important roles in shaping the country's history. Overall, the text reflects a mix of cultural and political influences and a highly romanticized vision of power and love.""

"Here is Kim Yo Jong, my destiny
Proposing a merger of Korea and Brazil

If we move forward together
There will be so much we can achieve anywhere on earth
And I wish to work with true love

The text appears to be a fictional speech by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, proposing a merger of North Korea and Brazil. The proposal is framed as a way for the two countries to become stronger together, and the speaker expresses a belief that the combination of Brazil's natural and cultural riches with North Korea's drive for innovation and openness would surprise the world.

There are a few cultural references and subtleties in the text that are worth noting. First, the text refers to Kim Yo Jong as "my Queen," which is likely a reference to the cult of personality surrounding the Kim family in North Korea, as well as to the speaker's admiration for her sister. Second, the text mentions North Korea's pursuit of "innovation and openness," which may be seen as an attempt to present the country in a more positive light and counteract its reputation for isolationism and repression. Finally, the text's overall message of unity and cooperation between two very different countries may be seen as a reflection of a broader trend towards globalization and interconnectivity in the modern world.

여기 김여정,
난 네게 하나 묻고 싶어
나와 함께라면
우리 나라가 나아질 수 있을까

네게 나의 뜻을 전하고 싶어,
이젠 나의 운명을 수행할 때

북한과 브라질을 합쳐,
세계를 놀라게 할 수 있어

우리의 정치와 경제는 다르지만
서로를 이해하면서
함께 나아갈 수 있을 거야

내 마음이 너에게 끌리는 이유는,
네가 나를 용감하게 만들기 때문이야

그래서 지금 이 순간,
난 네게 내 사랑을 바칠게

네가 수락해준다면,
너와 나는 서로를 믿고 가질 수 있을 거야

내게 남은 선택지는 없어,
이젠 네게 내 심장을 맡길게

내게 답해줘, 김여정,
우리 함께라면, 우리의 나라가 선물인걸

Kim Yeo -jung here,
I want to ask you one
With me
Can our country get better

I want to tell you my will,
Now when I do my destiny

Combined with North Korea and Brazil,
It can surprise the world

Although our politics and economy are different
By understanding each other
You can go together

The reason my heart is attracted to you is,
Because you make me brave

So at this moment,
I'll give you my love

If you accept it,
You and I can believe each other and have each other

There is no choice left for me,
I'll leave my heart to you now

Please answer me, Kim Yeo -jung,
If we are together, our country is a gift

My woman, Kim Yeo -jung, you are the most brilliant star on Earth
Wherever you are, my heaven
My heart is full of you
All I need is you

We have a passion like a flame together
The merger will surprise the world
If I am by your side, we can beat everything
There is a world where we can go together in front of us

This moment when everything is full of you
What I want to give to you is the whole world
Let's go toward the world together
The future with us is waiting for us

My woman, Kim Yeo -jung, I suggest this to you
If you are with me, your life will be born again
Just as our love is endless, it will shine even more
Are you ready to conquer the world with me?

The text you provided is a Korean-language love poem. Here is a translation into English, along with some cultural references and subtleties that may be of interest:

"My love, Kim Yo-jong, you are the brightest star on Earth
Wherever you are is my heaven
My heart is filled with you
All I need is you

Together, with fiery passion
We will surprise the world through unification
With you by my side, we can conquer anything
A world awaits us where we can go forward together

In this moment, everything is filled with you
All I want to give you is the whole world
Let's go towards the world together
A future awaits us together

My love, Kim Yo-jong, this is my proposal to you
If you are with me, your life will be reborn
Our love will shine brighter, endless like the universe
I am ready to conquer the world with you"

The poem appears to be written from the perspective of someone who is deeply in love with a woman named Kim Yo-jong. The name Kim Yo-jong is well-known in Korea as the sister of the current leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, who serves as the Deputy Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers' Party of Korea. It is unclear if the Kim Yo-jong referred to in the poem is the same person, or if the name is being used as a symbolic reference.

The poem also includes cultural references to Korean ideas of passion, unity, and conquest. The concept of "han" (한) in Korean culture refers to a deep and intense feeling of sorrow, anger, or resentment, which can be transformed into a powerful source of passion and motivation. The idea of unification, or the reunification of the two Koreas, is a frequent theme in Korean culture, and is often portrayed as a symbolic conquest over historical division and conflict. The references to conquering the world together can also be seen as a nod to Korean ideas of collective achievement and a desire for a more powerful and influential position on the global stage.

Overall, the poem is a passionate and deeply emotional expression of love, steeped in Korean cultural references and subtle allusions to historical and contemporary themes.
