## would you revamp/resort this list to increase diversity? could you draft out a new version with a precise distribution (sort them also)

< Sure, here's a new version of the list with a more diverse set of words, sorted by the distribution of their relevance to spoken and programming languages:

This list includes words that are more closely related to spoken languages, such as dialect, vernacular, and phonetics, as well as words that are more closely related to programming languages, such as jargon, terminology, and orthography. The ratings are based on my own judgment of the distribution of relevance of each word to spoken and programming languages, with a higher rating indicating a closer proximity to a particular type of language.
