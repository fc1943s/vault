## how the cognitive functions relate to it all? assigning to Ni Ne Si Se Fi Fe Ti Te

< Here is a sample monologue that explains how the cognitive functions relate to the experience of cultural conflict between pantheons:

"The cultural conflict between pantheons can be understood through the lens of the cognitive functions as described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Each of the eight functions - Ni (Introverted Intuition), Ne (Extraverted Intuition), Si (Introverted Sensing), Se (Extraverted Sensing), Fi (Introverted Feeling), Fe (Extraverted Feeling), Ti (Introverted Thinking), and Te (Extraverted Thinking) - plays a unique role in shaping our perspective on the cultural conflict and influencing the way we navigate this divide.

For those with a strong preference for Introverted Intuition (Ni), the cultural conflict may be seen as a struggle between the external world and the inner world. Ni types may feel a deep connection to their cultural heritage, and may struggle with the pressure to conform to cultural expectations, while at the same time feeling pulled towards their own internal values and beliefs.

Extraverted Intuition (Ne) types, on the other hand, may be more focused on exploring the possibilities and potential of different cultural systems. They may be drawn to the excitement of innovation and progress, and may see the cultural conflict as an opportunity to explore new ideas and possibilities.

For those with a strong preference for Introverted Sensing (Si), the cultural conflict may be experienced as a struggle between the past and the present. Si types may be deeply attached to their cultural roots and may feel a strong connection to the traditions and practices of their community. They may find it challenging to reconcile these traditions with the demands of the modern world.

Extraverted Sensing (Se) types, on the other hand, may be more focused on the here and now, and may be drawn to the experience of the present moment. They may see the cultural conflict as an opportunity to engage with the world in new and exciting ways.

For those with a strong preference for Introverted Feeling (Fi), the cultural conflict may be experienced as a struggle between personal values and cultural norms. Fi types may be deeply committed to their own internal values, and may find it challenging to reconcile these values with the expectations of their cultural community.

Extraverted Feeling (Fe) types, on the other hand, may be more focused on the emotional dynamics of the cultural conflict. They may be sensitive to the needs and feelings of those around them, and may see the cultural conflict as an opportunity to build bridges and create connections between different cultural groups.

For those with a strong preference for Introverted Thinking (Ti), the cultural conflict may be experienced as a struggle between logic and intuition. Ti types may be drawn to the rational analysis of cultural systems and may see the cultural conflict as an opportunity to understand the underlying patterns and structures that shape these systems.

Extraverted Thinking (Te) types, on the other hand, may be more focused on the practical implications of the cultural conflict. They may be drawn to the opportunity to put ideas into action and may see the cultural conflict as an opportunity to create meaningful change in the world.

Ultimately, the cultural conflict between pantheons is a complex and multifaceted experience, shaped by a variety of personal and cultural factors. Understanding the role that our cognitive functions play in shaping our perspective on this conflict can help us gain greater insight into our own experiences and develop more effective strategies for navigating this divide."

This monologue explains how the cognitive functions described by the MBTI can help understand the experience of cultural conflict between pantheons, highlighting the ways in which different functions may shape our perspective on this conflict and influence the way we navigate

## assign each cognitive function with how it sympathizes about the ideologies

< Here's a general draft list assigning each cognitive function with how it may sympathize with different ideologies:

Ni: The Visionary/The Reformer - Ni types may sympathize with progressive ideologies that prioritize change, innovation, and the betterment of society. They may also see themselves as visionaries who are able to look beyond the present moment and envision a better future for all.

Ne: The Explorer/The Rebel - Ne types may sympathize with more radical or libertarian ideologies that value freedom, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. They may also see themselves as rebels who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and question conventional wisdom.

Si: The Traditionalist/The Conservative - Si types may sympathize with conservative or traditionalist ideologies that prioritize stability, predictability, and the preservation of established social norms and values. They may also see themselves as protectors of the past, and believe in the importance of preserving traditions and customs.

Se: The Sensualist/The Hedonist - Se types may sympathize with liberal or libertarian ideologies that prioritize personal freedom, enjoyment, and the pursuit of physical pleasure. They may also see themselves as pleasure seekers who value immediate experiences and the satisfaction of their desires.

Fi: The Idealist/The Ethicist - Fi types may sympathize with progressive or ethical ideologies that prioritize individual values and personal responsibility. They may also see themselves as idealists who are motivated by a sense of morality and a desire to make the world a better place.

Fe: The Harmonizer/The Communitarian - Fe types may sympathize with conservative or traditionalist ideologies that prioritize community, social cohesion, and the well-being of the group. They may also see themselves as harmonizers who believe in the importance of working together for the common good.

Ti: The Analyst/The Skeptic - Ti types may sympathize with more skeptical or rational ideologies that prioritize logic, reason, and evidence. They may also see themselves as analysts who are motivated by a desire to understand the world and make sense of it.

Te: The Manager/The Pragmatist - Te types may sympathize with pragmatic or conservative ideologies that prioritize efficiency, productivity, and practicality. They may also see themselves as managers who are motivated by a desire to make things work and to achieve tangible results.

It's important to note that these associations are not absolute and that individual experiences and perspectives may vary widely. Additionally, political ideologies are complex and nuanced, and it's unlikely that any one person will align perfectly with a single political ideology.

MBTI=INFP (Fi Ne Si Te) Enneagram=4w5 Instinctual Variant=sx/sp Tritype=497 Socionics=SEI Big 5 (SLOAN)=RCUAI Attitudinal Psyche=ELFV Temperament=Phlegmatic (Dominant) Classic Jungian=IF(N)

lets say a hypotetic test subject has these results:
MBTI=INFP (Fi Ne Si Te) Enneagram=4w5 Instinctual Variant=sx/sp Tritype=497 Socionics=SEI Attitudinal Psyche=ELFV Temperament=Phlegmatic [Dominant) Classic Jungian=IF(N)

even though it is a complex mapping, how this exact depiction can be converted to the suggested FFM revamp using the 1-5 rating but as a easy to remember label?

to settle then, would it be better to use E/I O/D O/C F/U A/C or LMH for each dimension? could the first option use non-repeating letters?

what can be said about this set of labels? (rcoai | rcoan | rloan | rloai | rluai | rluan | rcuan | rcuai | rcoei | rcoen | rloen | rloei | rluei | rluen | rcuen | rcuei | scoai | scoan | sloan | sloai | sluai | sluan | scuan | scuai | scoei | scoen | sloen | sloei | sluei | sluen | scuen | scuei)

## the current lack of canon labeling on FFM might hinder the execution of this study, wouldn't you say? how FFM could be labeled from what we have now?

< The current lack of canon labeling for the Five Factor Model (FFM) can make it difficult to conduct validation studies and to accurately communicate the results of an assessment. The five broad dimensions of personality that make up the FFM are Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. However, there is no widely accepted canon labeling for these dimensions.

One approach to labeling the dimensions of the FFM would be to use simple, easy-to-understand terms that describe each trait, such as "Imaginative" for Openness to experience, "Reliable" for Conscientiousness, "Outgoing" for Extraversion, "Friendly" for Agreeableness, and "Anxious" for Neuroticism.

Another approach would be to use a numerical or letter-based rating system, such as a scale of 1 to 10 or a rating of "low," "medium," or "high" for each trait. This can be easy to understand and communicate, and can also be used to compare an individual's scores on each trait to the general population.

It's worth noting that these labeling suggestions are not considered canon and have not been widely accepted or validated by the scientific community, but they can be useful in order to convey the information in a more understandable way.

It's important to keep in mind that creating a canon labeling for the FFM would require a thorough research and validation process and would be a collaborative effort from the scientific community.

"Imaginative" for Openness to experience, "Reliable" for Conscientiousness, "Outgoing" for Extraversion, "Friendly" for Agreeableness, and "Anxious" for Neuroticism.
These words align with the dimensions of Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism, respectively.

Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
Imaginative, Reliable, Outgoing, Friendly, Anxious
Inquisitive, Diligent, Adventurous, Affable, Self-assured

Imaginative, Reliable, Outgoing, Friendly, Anxious.

## lets say the only canon is the first set, the rest is our study. from all words, which would be chosen from the criteria of being understood by the earliest age?

For Openness to experience, words like "curious," "explorer," or "adventurous" could be chosen.
For Conscientiousness, words like "responsible," "organized," or "reliable" could be chosen.
For Extroversion, words like "outgoing," "social," or "energetic" could be chosen.
For Agreeableness, words like "kind," "helpful," or "friendly" could be chosen.
For Neuroticism, words like "calm," "peaceful," or "happy" could be chosen.

For example, from mythology, one could use archetypes or gods/goddesses to label the dimensions, such as "Zeus" for Extraversion, "Athena" for Conscientiousness, "Apollo" for Openness to experience, "Aphrodite" for Agreeableness, and "Hera" for Neuroticism.

From poetry, one could use literary devices or figures of speech to label the dimensions, such as "Metaphor" for Openness to experience, "Simile" for Conscientiousness, "Hyperbole" for Extroversion, "Irony" for Agreeableness, and "Satire" for Neuroticism

From computer science, one could use programming concepts to label the dimensions, such as "Object-oriented" for Conscientiousness, "Functional" for Openness to experience, "Asynchronous" for Extroversion, "Event-driven" for Agreeableness, and "Structured" for Neuroticism

From music, one could use musical concepts or instruments to label the dimensions, such as "Harmony" for Agreeableness, "Rhythm" for Conscientiousness, "Melody" for Openness to experience, "Tempo" for Extroversion, and "Dynamics" for Neuroticism

Apollo, Athena, Zeus, Aphrodite, Hera
Metaphor, Simile, Hyperbole, Irony, Satire
Functional, Object-oriented, Asynchronous, Event-driven, Structured
Melody, Rhythm, Tempo, Harmony, Dynamics

The Five Factor Model (FFM) can be labeled in a similar way to other personality models such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Enneagram by using descriptive words or phrases that capture the essence of each dimension. These words or phrases could be chosen based on their comprehensibility, cultural relevance, and the level of detail they provide.

One way to label the FFM would be to use adjectives that describe each dimension, such as:

Openness to experience: curious, imaginative, open-minded, original
Conscientiousness: organized, responsible, reliable, diligent
Extraversion: outgoing, sociable, assertive, energetic
Agreeableness: kind, friendly, cooperative, empathetic
Neuroticism: anxious, sensitive, emotional, self-doubting
Another way would be to use nouns that describe the person with high or low levels of each dimension, such as:

Openness to experience: explorer, artist, intellectual, visionary
Conscientiousness: planner, administrator, manager, leader
Extraversion: life of the party, social butterfly, networker, extrovert
Agreeableness: peacemaker, mediator, helper, supporter
Neuroticism: worrier, perfectionist, introvert, sensitive.
It's worth noting that the labeling process is an ongoing research, the labels provided here are for the purpose of the example.
It's also important to note that, like the other models, FFM does not fully capture the complexity of human personality, and it should not be used to make definitive conclusions about an individual's personality.

## from all 16 mbti types, which way could be the appropriate one to sort them?

< The 16 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types can be sorted in a variety of ways, but one common way to categorize them is based on the four dichotomies of the MBTI:

1. Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)
2. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)
3. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
4. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)

Based on these dichotomies, the 16 MBTI types can be sorted into four groups of four types each:

1. ISTJ, ISFJ, INFJ, INTJ
2. ISTP, ISFP, INFP, INTP
3. ESTP, ESFP, ENFP, ENTP
4. ESTJ, ESFJ, ENFJ, ENTJ

Note that this is just one way to categorize the MBTI types and there may be other ways to sort them based on different criteria.

## you sorted 4 groups of 4. make it 1 group of 16 with canon sorting

<< Here is a common canon sorting of the 16 MBTI types based on their dichotomies:

1. ISTJ (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)
2. ISFJ (Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging)
3. INFJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)
4. INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging)
5. ISTP (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving)
6. ISFP (Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving)
7. INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving)
8. INTP (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving)
9. ESTP (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving)
10. ESFP (Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving)
11. ENFP (Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving)
12. ENTP (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving)
13. ESTJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)
14. ESFJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging)
15. ENFJ (Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)
16. ENTJ (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging)

This canon sorting is based on the order of the dichotomies, with Extraversion/Introversion being first, Sensing/Intuition being second, Thinking/Feeling being third, and Judging/Perceiving being fourth.

## apply dimensionality reduction to print CPM's typology in spreadsheet form

< As an AI language model, I can suggest using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a technique to reduce the dimensionality of the Comprehensive Personality Model's (CPM) typology and print it in a spreadsheet format.

PCA is a statistical method that can be used to identify the underlying patterns and relationships between different variables in a dataset. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, PCA can help simplify the analysis and visualization of complex data.

To apply PCA to the CPM's typology, one could create a dataset with the 16 personality types and their corresponding scores on the five factors of the FFM. The resulting dataset would have 16 rows and 5 columns.

Next, PCA could be used to identify the principal components of the dataset. The principal components are linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum amount of variation in the dataset. In the context of the CPM's typology, the principal components could represent the underlying patterns or dimensions of personality that are most relevant for understanding individual differences.

Once the principal components have been identified, the resulting scores could be plotted in a scatterplot or heatmap to visualize the relationships between different personality types and their corresponding traits. Alternatively, the scores could be printed in a spreadsheet format, with each row representing a personality type and each column representing a principal component.

By reducing the dimensionality of the CPM's typology using PCA, it becomes easier to identify and visualize the underlying patterns and relationships between different personality types and their corresponding traits.
