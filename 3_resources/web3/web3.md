The timeline for such integration will depend on a range of factors, including the pace of technological development, regulatory and legal considerations, and the level of investment and collaboration among companies and government agencies.

## how such symbiosis might be encoded on the smart contracts themselves?

< If rapid DNA analysis were to be integrated into blockchain-based payment systems like PIX, it could be encoded on smart contracts through the use of oracles or trusted third parties. Here are some possible ways that this integration could be achieved:

Oracle-based verification: Smart contracts could be programmed to call on external oracles that are responsible for verifying the results of DNA analysis. The smart contract would include a condition that requires a successful verification from the oracle before the transaction can be executed.

Trusted third-party verification: Alternatively, trusted third parties could be used to perform the DNA analysis and verify the results. The smart contract could include a condition that requires a successful verification from the trusted third party before the transaction can be executed.

Integration with existing verification systems: If DNA analysis is already being used for other purposes, such as biometric authentication or identity verification, the blockchain-based payment system could be integrated with these existing verification systems. The smart contract would include a condition that requires a successful verification from the existing system before the transaction can be executed.

In all of these scenarios, the use of smart contracts would provide a secure and transparent way to execute blockchain-based transactions that rely on rapid DNA analysis. The specific implementation details would depend on the needs and requirements of the Brazilian financial system, as well as the capabilities of the rapid DNA analysis technology and verification systems. It would also be important to ensure that the use of DNA analysis in blockchain transactions is in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and that the technology is used in a way that protects user privacy.
