## estimate the training hours from 50wpm to 120wpm (with proper remarks)

< Estimating the number of training hours needed to increase your typing speed from 50 WPM to 120 WPM can be challenging, as it depends on individual factors such as learning ability, consistency, and the quality of practice. However, with some general assumptions, we can provide a rough estimate.

Assumptions:

1. You have a strong foundation in touch typing and can maintain 50 WPM with good accuracy.
2. You follow all the mechanical tips and practice techniques mentioned previously.
3. You practice consistently and effectively.

With these assumptions, it might take around 200-300 hours of dedicated practice to increase your typing speed from 50 WPM to 120 WPM. This estimate should be taken with caution, as individual progress can vary widely. Here are some remarks to consider:

1. Consistency: Practicing regularly (e.g., daily) is crucial for steady progress. Sporadic practice can hinder improvement and may even cause regression in typing speed.
2. Quality of practice: Focusing on accuracy and implementing proper typing techniques during practice sessions will yield better results.
3. Plateaus: You may experience plateaus in your progress, where your typing speed remains stagnant for a period. Be patient, and consider adjusting your practice methods or seeking guidance to overcome these plateaus.
4. Individual factors: Factors such as age, previous typing experience, finger dexterity, and learning ability can impact the time it takes to reach 120 WPM. Your progress may be faster or slower than the estimate provided.
5. Goal-setting: Setting achievable short-term goals can help you stay motivated and measure progress. Adjust your goals as needed and celebrate milestones.

Remember, these estimates and remarks are meant to serve as a guide rather than a definitive timeline. Focus on consistent, quality practice and remain patient, as improving your typing speed is a gradual process that requires time and dedication.
