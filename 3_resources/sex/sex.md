< Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell
'Bout the changes in society, the rise and the fell
The family's individualized, it's every man for himself
The collective to the singular, the group to the wealth

Birth rates are down, people choosing their own way
Marriage and fidelity, ain't what they used to say
Step-parents, half-siblings, and independent plays
No more unconditional love, it's just a passing phase

Sexuality's liberated, no more reproduction game
Pleasure's the prize, it's no longer a shame
But is it just a distraction, to keep us tame?
A society of consumers, pleasure's the only aim

Exhibitionism's the norm, no more privacy
Social media, the only way to show your identity
Sex and love, democratized for all to see
A world of freedom, but is it all just vanity?

In the end, who are we? Virtuous or sinful?
A society of contradictions, constantly in limbo
We say one thing, but do another, it's all so simple
Intimacy's the only place to be, where we can truly know.
