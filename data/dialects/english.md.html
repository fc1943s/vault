  <p id = "para-1">Eminem woke up in a cold sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. He had been dreaming about Lucca and the violent scene he had witnessed. It had felt all too real, and Eminem was still shaking from the intensity of the dream.</p>
<p id = "para-2">He stumbled out of bed and made his way to the kitchen, trying to calm his nerves. As he poured himself a glass of water, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. It was as if the dream had left an imprint on his mind, and he couldn’t shake it.</p>
<p id = "para-3">As he sat at his kitchen table, trying to make sense of it all, he heard a knock at the door. He got up to answer it, half-expecting to see Lucca standing there. Instead, he found a man he didn’t recognize.</p>
<p id = "para-4">“Hey, man,” the stranger said, flashing a smile. “I was just passing through the neighborhood and thought I’d drop by to say hi.”</p>
<p id = "para-5">Eminem was instantly on guard. He didn’t know this guy, and something about him set off alarm bells in his head. But before he could say anything, the stranger pushed past him and made his way into the kitchen.</p>
<p id = "para-6">“Nice place you got here,” the man said, looking around. “Real cozy.”</p>
<p id = "para-7">Eminem tried to keep his cool, but he was starting to feel uneasy. He didn’t like the way this guy was acting, and he didn’t want him in his house.</p>
<p id = "para-8">“Listen, man,” Eminem said, stepping closer to the stranger. “I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave.”</p>
<p id = "para-9">The man just laughed, as if he found Eminem’s warning amusing. “Relax, man,” he said. “I’m not here to cause any trouble. I just wanted to see what you’re up to.”</p>
<p id = "para-10">Eminem didn’t believe him for a second. He knew this guy was trouble, and he needed to get him out of his house before things got out of hand.</p>
<p id = "para-11">“Look,” Eminem said, his voice rising. “I don’t know what your game is, but you need to get out of here. Now.”</p>
<p id = "para-12">The stranger just smiled and took a step closer to Eminem. “You don’t understand,” he said, his voice low and menacing. “I’m not leaving until I get what I came for.”</p>
<p id = "para-13">Eminem felt a surge of fear wash over him. He didn’t know what this guy wanted, but he knew he needed to get out of there. He made a break for the door, but the stranger was too quick. He caught Eminem by the arm and pulled him back.</p>
<p id = "para-14">Eminem struggled, but the stranger was too strong. He held Eminem in a tight grip, whispering in his ear.</p>
<p id = "para-15">“You can’t escape me, Eminem,” the stranger said. “I’ll always be here, watching. Waiting.”</p>
<p id = "para-16">And with that, the stranger disappeared, leaving Eminem alone in his kitchen, shaken and terrified. He didn’t know who that guy was, but he knew one thing for sure: he never wanted to see him again.</p>

He had been dreaming about this moment for years, and now it was finally here. The man was a notorious drug lord who had been terrorizing the neighborhood for years, and Kendrick had been tasked with taking him down.</p>
<p id = "para-18">Kendrick took a deep breath and grabbed his gun, feeling a sense of nervous energy coursing through his veins. He had never killed anyone before, but he knew that he had no choice if he wanted to protect his community.</p>
<p id = "para-19">As he approached the man, he could feel his heart pounding in his chest. The man looked up and saw Kendrick, but before he could react, Kendrick pulled out his gun and fired. The man slumped over, dead before he hit the ground.</p>
<p id = "para-20">Kendrick felt a rush of adrenaline as he watched the man’s body hit the pavement. He knew that he had done the right thing, but the weight of what he had just done was starting to sink in. He felt a mix of emotions - relief that the drug lord was no longer a threat, but also guilt and sadness that it had come to this.</p>
<p id = "para-21">As he walked away from the scene, Kendrick couldn’t help but think about how he had come to this point. He had grown up in a neighborhood where violence and crime were a daily reality, and he had seen firsthand how it could destroy lives.</p>
<p id = "para-22">But he had also seen the power of music and art to inspire change and bring people together. That was why he had become a rapper - to use his platform to speak out against injustice and inspire his community to come together and make a change.</p>
<p id = "para-23">And now, as he walked away from the scene of the crime, Kendrick knew that he had taken a step towards making his community a better place. It was a small victory, but it was a start.</p>

<p id = "para-41">I’m about to drop some real knowledge, So listen up, you cruel monsters, it’s time to acknowledge The power of love, and how it’s generated By the supreme Jove, who created A new kind of seed, with a new kind of sex Beautiful and malicious, and oh so complex Their chests, reserved for the Furies alone But Cupid’s arrows can pierce to the bone Don’t be ashamed of the flames of desire Even Jove himself was once consumed by their fire Whether in hell or up in the skies Love can burn bright, but it can also capsize Look at Narcissus and Hippolytus, and learn To be kind and compassionate, and never spurn Fedra’s love, even if it’s twisted and wrong Show her mercy, and help her move on Tirse sees good things in your future Don’t be blind to love, don’t be a loser Like Triton, who burned for Nereus’ daughter Tisbe was elusive, but he finally caught her With the help of Proteus, the sea shepherd Tisbe’s heart finally opened, no longer weathered When Girce was betrayed by Ulisses Triton vowed to avenge her, and he seized The winds and waves, and brought the Greeks to their knees Tisbe surrendered, and they had a million kisses, if you please From their love, the ocean was filled with new life Triton and Nereus had a brand new strife So listen up, young men, and learn the rules Of love and life, don’t be anyone’s fool Be careful, be cautious, don’t fall for the traps That love can set, and never look back With these lessons, you’ll conquer hearts and minds And build a legacy that will stand the test of time</p>
