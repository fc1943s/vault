  <p id = "para-1"><b>7. I now compose and string together all the Supreme Truth that I come to know through the Divine Glance bestowed upon me by my Lord Guru Ramana, who destroyed my delusion caused by the ego sense, leaving me in a state of clarity.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2"><b>2 The Benefit or Fruit of this Work</b></p>
<p id = "para-3"><b>8. The benefit of this <em>Light of Supreme Truth</em> is the understanding that there is not the least thing such as ‘attainment’, since the Supreme Self is the Ever-Attained One Whole. Thus the mental wanderings caused by striving towards <em>Dharma</em>, <em>Artha</em>, and <em>Kama</em> are also removed.</b></p>
<p id = "para-4"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Up till now the <em>shastras</em> have prescribed, as the rightful goals of human life, the following four aims:</p>
<p id = "para-5"><em>Dharma</em>: the practice of righteous social duties. <em>Artha</em>: the acquisition of wealth through righteous means. <em>Kama</em>: the satisfaction of desires within righteous limits. <em>Moksha</em>: liberation, the natural state of abiding as Self.</p>
<p id = "para-6">This work, <em>The Light of Supreme Truth</em> shows us now that the first three worldly aims are futile and transitory, and thus it removes our wandering mental efforts to attain them. We may however still think, “Is not mental effort at least needed to obtain <em>Moksha</em>?” but again this Light shows us the meaninglessness of striving to ‘attain’ Self, which is ever-attained, and instead it recommends the cessation of all mental activity, thereby fixing us in the eternal, motionless and ever-attained State of Self. Is there therefore any Supreme Goal other than that which is given here, through this <em>Light of Supreme Truth</em>? Refer to verse 1204.</p>
<p id = "para-7"><b>9. Self, which is one’s own true nature, is the substratum of all happiness in this and in other worlds. Therefore, to be firmly established in Self, unshaken by thoughts concerning the various other paths [Karmas, Yogas etc.,] which will lead only to the pleasures of this and of other worlds, is the fruit of this work.</b></p>
<p id = "para-8"><b>3 The Submission to the Assembly</b></p>
<p id = "para-9"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: It was the tradition in ancient days for a writer to submit his work to an Assembly of learned men. He therefore had to compose a verse of ‘Submission’, requesting the Assembly to correct any error found in his work.</p>
<p id = "para-10"><b>10. When scrutinized it will be found that these sweet verses of <em>The Collection of the Guru’s Sayings</em> have not been composed by my dull and deluded thinking mind, but that they have been inspired without thought by the Divine Venkatavan [Sri Ramana].</b></p>
<p id = "para-11"><b>11. Why should I offer a ‘Submission to the Assembly’ for a work which has not been done with the sense of doership, ‘I’? The whole responsibility for this work belongs to Him, the Supreme Lord [Sri Ramana], whom even the Great Ones can realize only through the <em>Samadhi</em> of Mystic Silence within their hearts.</b></p>
<p id = "para-12"><b>4 Dedication</b></p>
<p id = "para-13"><b>12. Since it was my mother who helped me [in giving me this birth] to achieve the Attainment [<em>Jnana</em>] dispelling ignorance, I gratefully present this work to Her. “Let this be a dedication to her pure heart which knew not any deceit.”</b></p>
<p id = "para-14"><b>5 The Author</b></p>
<p id = "para-15"><b>13. Kanna Murugan [Sri Muruganar], who through the look of Grace has seen <em>Chit</em>, the grandeur of all wealth, is merely the Divine Feet of his Master [Sri Ramana], strung into a garland some of his Guru’s words and has given it [to the world] as the Supreme Treasure.</b></p>
<h2 id = "link-1">PART ONE</h2>
<h2 id = "link-2">AN ANALYSIS OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p id = "para-16"><b>Benedictory Verses</b></p>
<p id = "para-17"><b>14. In response to the great and befitting penance [<em>tapas</em>] performed by the ocean-girdled Mother Earth, the nameless and formless Supreme <em>Brahman</em> Itself took the glorious name and form of Sri Ramana <em>Sadguru</em>. May those spotlessly pure Feet – <em>Sat-Chit</em> [Existence-Consciousness] – be in our hearts.</b></p>
<p id = "para-18"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The <em>tapas</em> performed by Mother Earth is a poetic way of referring to the intense longing for Truth of many matured aspirants on Earth. This longing naturally brings forth the Supreme in the form of a <em>Sadguru</em> such as Sri Ramana.</p>
<p id = "para-19"><b>15. Self, that pure <em>Brahman</em> which is Itself the Mono-syllable, shining as the heart of all beings and things, is the excellent and sweet benediction to this <em>Collection of the Guru’s Sayings</em>, which removes the delusion of ignorant ones.</b></p>
<p id = "para-20"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is worth referring here to one stray verse of Sri Bhagavan Ramana: “One Syllable shines for ever in the Heart as Self; who can write It down?” The One Syllable mentioned in both cases is ‘I’ [<em>Aham</em>] or Self, which is unwritable, being beyond thought, word or expression.</p>
<p id = "para-21"><b>16. The experience of our own Existence, which is the Supreme Reality, <em>Jnana</em> Itself, shines as the Mystic Silence and is the True Self behind the fictitious first person ‘I’. May that Absolute Supreme Self, [known as] the Feet, be upon our heads.</b></p>
<p id = "para-22"><b>17. For those who turn within, the perfect asset is the Grace of Guru Ramana, whose true form is the sleepless-sleep [<em>Turiya</em>]; it is the sweet Fruit whose juice is the supremely pure Bliss that creates in the aspirant an ever-increasing taste, free from aversion, and It is the beautiful Lamp which, without need of kindling, leads one to the Heart.</b></p>
<p id = "para-23"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Grace is here shown to be the same as <em>Turiya</em>, the true form of Guru Ramana, which shines eternally as ‘I-I’, the self-luminous Heart and is therefore called the lamp which needs no kindling.</p>
<p id = "para-24">There are two possible translations of the next verse:</p>
<p id = "para-25"><b>18a. My Master Sri Ramana has taken possession of me, destroying the miseries caused by my inattention to Self; His beauty is His Oneness with <em>Jnana</em> and His True Form lies beyond both attachment and detachment. His Feet are the perfect example of all precepts of the Truth.</b></p>
<p id = "para-26"><b>18b. My Master Sri Ramana has taken possession of me, destroying the miseries caused by my inattention to Self. Though He has the beauty of <em>Jnana</em> and Renunciation, His True Form lies beyond both attachment and detachment, and His Feet are the perfect example of all precepts of the Truth.</b></p>
<p id = "para-27"><b>1 The Truth or Reality of the World</b></p>
<p id = "para-28"><b>19. As cause alone is seen as its effect, and since Consciousness [<em>Brahman</em>], which is the cause, is as clearly true as an <em>amalaka</em> fruit on one’s palm, this vast universe, its effect, which is described in the scriptures as mere names and forms, may also be called true.</b></p>
<p id = "para-29"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Brahman</em> has five aspects, <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda-NamaRupa</em> [i.e., Being, Awareness, Bliss, name and form]. The first three aspects are real, being eternally Self-shining, whereas name and form are unreal aspects, since they merely seem to exist, depending upon the illumination of <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-30">If, however, one sees the cause, <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, which is real, one may say, ignoring the apparent names and forms, that this universe is also real.</p>
<p id = "para-31"><b>20. When viewed from the standpoint of the eternally self-existent Cause, even the three, seven or twenty-one worlds will appear to be real. But when one sees only the names and forms of the world as real, then even <em>Brahman</em>, their cause, will appear to be absolutely non-existent or void [<em>sunya</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-32"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The three, seven and twenty-one worlds occur in different traditional, cosmological classifications.</p>
<p id = "para-33"><b>21. For the sake of those [ignorant ones] who take the world, which appears before them, as real and enjoyable [it became necessary for the scriptures to say that] it is God’s creation. But for those who have obtained unobstructed Knowledge of Self, the world is seen merely as a bondage-causing mental imagination.</b></p>
<p id = "para-34"><b>22. This world of empty names and forms, which are the imagination of the five senses and an appearance in the pure Supreme Self, should be understood to be the mysterious play of <em>Maya</em>, the mind, which rises as if real from Self, <em>Sat-Chit</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-35"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The origin of <em>Maya</em>, meaning “that which is not” is unknown; it appears, functioning in man, as mind, and is inferred in God through his actions, sustenance, and dissolution of this whole universe; it ends, on being seen to be non-existent, when the Truth is known.</p>
<p id = "para-36">The seer, known as mind or ‘I’, and the seen, known as the world, rise and set simultaneously in Self. If Self sees Itself through Itself, it is Self; if It sees Itself through the mind or ‘seer’, it appears as the world or ‘seen’.</p>
<p id = "para-37"><b>23. The Realised who do not know anything as being other than Self, which is absolute Consciousness, will not say that the world, which has no existence in the view of the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>, is real.</b></p>
<p id = "para-38"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The Tamil word <em>Iraivan</em> is usually understood as meaning God, the Lord of this world, and as Bhagavan has elsewhere explained, the trinity of soul, world and their Lord will always appear to co-exist in <em>Maya</em>, and thus the apparent world does exist in the view of its apparent Lord, God. Therefore, on seeing this verse, Bhagavan remarked “Who said that there is no world in God’s view?”, but when the author, Sri Muruganar, explained that he had used the word in the sense of the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>, Sri Bhagavan accepted this meaning and approved the verse.</p>
<p id = "para-39"><b>24. O man, like a parrot waiting expectantly for the silk-cotton fruit to ripen, you persist in your sufferings, believing this world appearance to be real and enjoyable; if the world is real simply because it appears to your senses, then a mirage would be water.</b></p>
<p id = "para-40"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The fruit of a silk-cotton tree always remains green, not turning colour even after ripening; the parrot meanwhile waits expectantly, hoping to eat it when it changes colour, but is finally disappointed when it bursts, scattering its hairy seeds.</p>
<p id = "para-41"><b>25. Forgetting Self, which gives you [the seer] light to see, and being confused, do not run after this appearance [the world which you see]. The appearance will disappear, and is hence not real, but Self, the source of you [the seer], can never disappear, so know that That alone is real.</b></p>
<p id = "para-42"><b>26. Is the word ‘Real’ befitting to this world, which is seen only by the illusory and changeful mind, but not by Self, the source of mind?</b></p>
<p id = "para-43"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: As Self knows Itself alone to be, any imagination such as this world is entirely non-existent to It, and thus is never seen by It.</p>
<p id = "para-44"><b>27. Fear not on seeing this empty world, which appears as a dream in the sleep of Self-forgetfulness. This imaginary and bondage-causing world-picture, [projected on the background] of the dark, dense mind, will not stand in the light of Supreme Knowledge, <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-45"><b>28. O aspirants who hide yourselves away fearing this world, nothing such as a world exists! Fearing this false world which appears to exist, is like fearing the false snake which appears in a rope.</b></p>
<p id = "para-46"><b>29. This world is only seen without doubts in the waking and dream states where thoughts have risen and are at play. Can it be seen in sleep where not even a single thought rises? Thoughts alone [therefore] are the substratum of this world.</b></p>
<p id = "para-47"><b>30. If it is thus said that this world is a mere play of thoughts, why, even when the mind is quiet, does the world-scene, like a dream, suddenly appear in front of us? That is due to the stored momentum of past imaginations!</b></p>
<p id = "para-48"><b>31. Just as the spider emits the thread [of its web] out from its own mouth and again withdraws it back, so the mind projects the world out from itself and again absorbs it back within.</b></p>
<p id = "para-49"><b>32. When the mind passes through the brain and the five senses, the names and forms [of this world] are projected out from within. When the mind abides in the Heart, they return and lie buried there.</b></p>
<p id = "para-50"><b>33. This world, full of differences of names and forms, will remain as [the undifferentiated] <em>Brahman</em> when these are removed. The ignorant one masks the Supreme with imaginary names and forms and, being thereby self-deluded, sees Him as the world.</b></p>
<p id = "para-51"><b>34. The deceptive I-am-the-body idea alone makes the world, which is an appearance of names and forms, seem real, and thereby it at once binds itself with desires [for the world].</b></p>
<p id = "para-52"><b>35. Since this world of dyads and triads appears only in the mind, like the illusory ring of fire formed [in darkness] by whirling the single point of a glowing rope-end, it is false, and it does not exist in the clear sight of Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-53"><b>36. O worldly-minded man who is unable to understand the wise reasoning and the teachings of Sages about the Supreme Knowledge, if properly scrutinized, this big universe of delusion is seen to be nothing but the illusive play of the <em>vasanas</em> [mental tendencies] within you.</b></p>
<p id = "para-54"><b>37. Like the illusory yellow seen by a jaundiced eye, the whole world that you see before you is the product of your own mind, which is full of deceptive vices such as desire [anger, lust and so on]. In reality, however, it is a plenitude of pure <em>Jnana</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-55"><b>38. Just as ‘yellow’ fades away in the sunlight, the appearance of this world disappears in the Light of Self-Knowledge, and therefore it cannot be a creation of the Supreme [Self]. It is merely like the beautiful colour designs which appear on a peacock’s plumage; that is to say, it is only the reflection of the <em>vasanas</em> within you.</b></p>
<p id = "para-56"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: ‘Yellow’ in South India refers to turmeric, whose stain fades away in sunlight.</p>
<p id = "para-57">Beautiful colour designs, which are not seen on each individual peacock feather, appear on its plumage, due to the combination and positioning of many feathers.</p>
<p id = "para-58"><b>39. This world is a mere illusion seen in the deluded objective sight of the ego, which is simply the ‘I-am-the-body’ idea. In the sight of Self-Knowledge, however, it is as false as the apparent blueness in the sky.</b></p>
<p id = "para-59"><b>40. How does this false and villainous vast world, that cheats and ravages the minds of all people [except the wise], come into existence? Because of no reason other than our own mistake in falling away from, instead of clinging to, Self-attention.</b></p>
<p id = "para-60"><b>41. This life, an illusion based upon [our] likes and dislikes, is an empty dream, which appears, as if real, during the sleep [of ignorance], but which is found to be false when one wakes up [into Self-Knowledge].</b></p>
<p id = "para-61"><b>42. When the mind is least in pure Supreme Self-Consciousness, all the powers which seemed to function [through the mind], such as ‘<em>Icheha’</em> [will-power], ‘<em>Kriya’</em> [the power of action] and ‘<em>Jnana’</em> [the power of knowing], will cease, being found to be imaginary.</b></p>
<p id = "para-62"><b>43. The projected picture of this world of triads is a play of <em>Chit-Para-Shakti</em> [i.e., the power or reflected light of Self-Consciousness] on the screen of Supreme Consciousness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-63"><b>44. The appearance of this illusory world, which is seen as real, is just like the serpent seen in a rope, the thief seen in a tree-stump or the water seen in a mirage.</b></p>
<p id = "para-64"><b>45. The various ornaments fashioned out of gold are not different from the gold, and similarly, this world of moving and unmoving things, manifested out of Self, cannot be other than Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-65"><b>46. Self is hidden when the world appears, but when Self shines forth, the world will disappear. Being different in nature, like the [apparent] dog [seen in] the stone, both cannot be seen together.</b></p>
<p id = "para-66"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em> and <em>Michael James</em></b>: The nature of Self, the true aspect of <em>Brahman</em>, is not these names and forms, whereas the nature of the world, the false aspect of <em>Brahman</em>, is not <em>Sat-ChitAnanda</em>, so both cannot be seen simultaneously. See also verses 876, 877, 1216.</p>
<p id = "para-67"><b>47. This world which appears, concealing Self, is a mere dream, but when ‘concealed’ by Self, it remains as none other than Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-68"><b>48. This whole world of triads which deludes us, seeming to be an undisputable reality, is only the form of the Supreme Power [<em>Chit-Shakti</em>], which abides eternally as none other than the Supreme Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-69"><b>49. As the fire shines hidden within the smoke, the Light of Knowledge shines hidden within the names and forms of this world. When the mind is made clear by Supreme Grace, the nature of the world is found to be real [as Self], and it will appear no more as the illusory names and forms.</b></p>
<p id = "para-70"><b>50. For those who never lose the True Knowledge of Self, which is the base of all sense-knowledge, the world also is nothing other than Self-Knowledge. But, how can an ordinary man, who has not gained Self-knowledge, understand the statement of Sages who, seeing through <em>Jnana</em>, say that the world is real?</b></p>
<p id = "para-71"><b>51. Those who have given up worldly [i.e. sense-] knowledge and attachment to it, and who have destroyed the evil force of mind [i.e. <em>Maya</em>], thus gaining Supreme Self-Consciousness, alone can know the correct meaning of the statement, “The world is Real”.</b></p>
<p id = "para-72"><b>52. If one’s outlook is changed into <em>Jnana</em> [Divine Wisdom], seen through That, the entire universe, consisting of the five elements such as ether and so on, will be found to be real, being the Supreme Knowledge Itself. Thus you should see.</b></p>
<p id = "para-73"><b>53. If one’s outlook is changed into <em>Jnana</em>, seen through That, this same world, seen previously as a hell of misery, will be found to be a heaven of Bliss.</b></p>
<p id = "para-74"><b>54. As per the saying “The seen cannot differ from the seeing eyes”, the <em>Jnani</em>, whose eye [i.e. outlook] has become <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em> due to the cessation of all mental activities, sees this world also as <em>Sat-ChitAnanda</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-75"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: See verse 343.</p>
<p id = "para-76"><b>55. The appearance of this world, like the illusory appearance of a dream, is merely mental and its truth [therefore] can be known correctly only by the Supreme Consciousness that transcends <em>Maya</em>, the mind.</b></p>

<p id = "para-115"><b>83. From his condescending opening words, “Because we see the world”, it is to be understood that the Great Master, Bhagavan Sri Ramana, who gives the most practical assistance to aspirants, sets aside all other doctrines and teaches that only the ‘Doctrine of <em>Vivartha’</em> is suitable to be taken as true.</b></p>
<p id = "para-116"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: ‘Because we see the world’ are the first words of verse one of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, Bhagavan’s forty-verse poem on the nature of reality.</p>
<p id = "para-117">Though His experience of the Truth can only be adequately expressed by the ‘<em>Doctrine of Ajata</em>’, Bhagavan Sri Ramana uses only the ‘<em>Doctrine of Vivartha</em>’ for His Teachings.</p>
<p id = "para-118">Assuming a cause and its effect, religions generally teach that God has created individual souls and the world; some teach the ‘<em>Doctrine of Dwaita</em>’ [duality], which postulates that all these three [God, souls and the world] will eternally remain separate; others teach the ‘<em>Doctrine of Vishishtadwaita</em>’ [Qualified non-duality], which postulates that though duality now prevails, the souls and the world will at some later time merge into union with God; others again teach the ‘<em>Doctrine of Advaita</em>’ [Non-duality], which postulates that even now, though they seem to be separate, these three are in truth mere appearances and are none other than the one Reality; and many other doctrines are also taught by various religions.</p>
<p id = "para-119">Aspirants may be graded into four levels of maturity, dull <em>[manda],</em> medium <em>[madhyama]</em>, ripe <em>[teevra]</em> and fully ripe <em>[Ati teevra]</em>; those of the first two grades will readily accept the ‘<em>Doctrine of Dwaita</em>’ or ‘<em>Vishishtadwaita</em>’.</p>
<p id = "para-120">The ‘<em>Doctrine of Vivartha</em>’ is recommended to explain the standpoint of <em>Advaita</em>, i.e., to explain how the world-appearance, its seer, and the seer’s knowledge of the appearance all come into existence simultaneously, unconditioned by cause and effect. However, since this accepts the appearance of the world, souls and God, it is only a working hypothesis to help aspirants. The ‘<em>Doctrine of Ajata</em>’, on the other hand, never accepts even the appearance of this trinity, but proclaims that the One Self-shining Reality alone exists eternally and without modification; <em>Ajata</em> is therefore the highest of all doctrines and it is only suitable for the fully-ripened aspirants.</p>
<p id = "para-121">Bhagavan Sri Ramana therefore comes down condescendingly and, setting aside ‘<em>Ajata</em>’ and the two lower doctrines, He advocates through His <em>Forty Verses on Reality</em> the ‘<em>Doctrine of Vivartha</em>’ which is suitable for the ripe aspirants who have no faith in the lower doctrines, yet do not have the maturity to grasp the highest, ‘<em>Ajata</em>’.</p>

<p id = "para-125"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Through Self-enquiry the confused doubter, who is the ego, will lose his identity and be drowned in Self; it will then be discovered that neither ignorance nor confusion ever existed for Self, but only for the non-existent ego.</p>

<p id = "para-128"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is thus concluded there that it is not Self but ignorance, due to non-enquiry, which is the real cause of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the world. Refer also to verse 91.</p>

<p id = "para-133"><b>92. When, in the view of the one indivisible space, even the pot has no separate existence, is it not foolish to say that the space inside the pot moves with the movements of the pot?</b></p>
<p id = "para-134"><b>93. Similarly, when, in the plenitude of Self-Consciousness, body and world cannot even exist, being non-Self and incomplete, it is ridiculous to say that Self moves because of the movements of the mutable body and world.</b></p>
<p id = "para-135"><b>94. Though Self, which is ever still because of Its wholeness, seems to move with the movements of the unsteady mirror, the mind, it is never the real Self that moves, but only its reflection, the mind.</b></p>

Thus you should know!</b></p>
<p id = "para-137"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: There is no experience of the <em>upadhis</em> in <em>Jnana</em>, and therefore they appear only to the ignorant and never to the <em>Jnani</em>. Having heard this, the ignorant still ask the <em>Jnani</em> how their wrong outlook has come into being, but they should understand that a <em>Jnani</em> can never admit that <em>upadhis</em> exist for Self, and that it is therefore the responsibility of the ignorant to discover for themselves how and for whom the <em>upadhis</em> appear. Thus, Bhagavan often used to counter-question his devotees, and say, “You claim that <em>upadhis</em> have come into being and are real, and so you alone must find out what they are, and how, from where, and to whom they appear!”</p>
<p id = "para-138">This illustrates why the ‘<em>Doctrine of Vivartha</em>’ [i.e. simultaneous creation] is suited to the questioner’s point of view, which only admits ‘<em>Ajata</em>’ [i.e. non-creation]. The note to verse 83 may also be referred to here.</p>
<p id = "para-139"><b>96. A spark of fire can fly out only for a fire-ball of limited size [and it could not do so from a fire which is unlimited and all pervading].

<p id = "para-140"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This means that the world, God and <em>jivas</em> appear only in the view of the <em>jiva</em>, who is a false reflection of Self, and that, in the supreme viewpoint of Self, there is no creation at all.</p>
<p id = "para-141"><b>97. The body exists only in the view of the mind, which is deluded and drawn outwards by the power of <em>Maya</em>.

<p id = "para-142"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In scriptures like the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, the Divine Masters have condescended to use terms such as ‘<em>Dehi</em>’ and ‘<em>Kshetrajna</em>’, because of the inability of their disciples to understand if the truth were stated otherwise.</p>
<p id = "para-143"><b>98. Unless the body is taken to be ‘I’, otherness – the world of moving and unmoving objects – cannot be seen. Hence, because otherness – the creatures and their Creator – does not exist, it is wrong to call Self the Witness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-144"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In the scriptures the terms ‘<em>Jiva sakshi</em>’ [i.e. witness of the <em>jiva</em>] and ‘<em>Sarva sakshi</em>’ [i.e. witness of everything] are used only as a formality, but they are not strictly correct. Only when there is something to be seen can there be a seer or ‘witness’ to see it. But in a state of oneness, where no others exist, who will witness what? Therefore Self, which is One without a second, cannot be called the witness.</p>
<p id = "para-145"><b>99. The world does not exist apart from the body; the body does not exist apart from the mind; the mind does not exist apart from Consciousness; and Consciousness does not exist apart from Self, which is Existence.</b></p>

<p id = "para-150"><b>101. It is this same ‘<em>Ajata</em>’ that Sri Krishna revealed to Arjuna in an early Chapter [two] of the <em>Gita</em>, and know that it was only because of the latter’s bewilderment and inability to grasp the Truth, that other doctrines were then taught in the remaining sixteen chapters.</b></p>
<p id = "para-151"><b>8 The Purpose behind the Diverse Theories of Creation</b></p>
<p id = "para-152"><b>102. Why do the different portions of the <em>Vedas</em> describe creation in different ways? Their sole intention is not to proclaim a correct theory of creation, but to make the aspirant enquire into the Truth which is the Source of creation.</b></p>
<p id = "para-153"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If creation were true, the scriptures would describe it in only one manner, but their diverse theories make it clear that creation is not the truth. To enable ripe aspirants to discover the falsity of the notion of creation, the <em>Vedas</em> purposely teach contradictory theories. However, such contradictions are found only in the descriptions of creation, they never occur when the <em>Vedas</em> attempt to describe the nature of Self, the Supreme. Concerning Self, they all agree and speak in one voice, saying ‘Self is One, Perfect, Whole, Immortal, Unchanging, Self-shining etc., etc.’ From this we should understand that the deep intention behind such conflicting theories of creation is to indirectly show aspirants the necessity of enquiring into Self, which is the Source of all ideas of creation.</p>
<p id = "para-154"><b>9 The Part Played by God</b></p>
<p id = "para-155"><b>103. By His own Power of <em>Maya</em>, the Unchanging One, [though shining more directly than anything else], hides Himself unseen, and throws the rope of the three states into the space of the mind; keeping it upright. He then makes the <em>jiva</em>, who mistakes the body as ‘I’, balance on it, and thus He plays His divine game!</b></p>
<p id = "para-156"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The three states are waking, dreaming and deep sleep.</p>
<p id = "para-157">A magician’s trick performed by village entertainers in India is used as a simile here. The magician, hiding himself behind a screen, throws a rope into the air and, making it appear to stand upright, he orders his assistant to climb it and balance on its top. Here, God is equated to the magician; the Heart is His hiding place; the three states are compared to the rope; and the <em>jiva</em> is compared to the assistant. But all of this is a game, only appearing in the onlookers’ sight, and hence it is unreal. Similarly, creation, sustenance and dissolution, which appear to be God’s ‘<em>Lila</em>’ [i.e. divine game] are all unreal, as they are seen only by the ignorant.</p>
<p id = "para-158"><b>104. In the view of the ignorant it may sometimes appearas if the Supreme Lord, who gave power of authority to <em>Maya</em>, is Himself bound by her deceitful orders [to delude <em>jivas</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-159"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The significance of saying that the Lord gives power of authority to <em>Maya</em> is the experience of an aspirant who, while abiding as Self, becomes inattentive and allows the ‘I’-thought to arise. If this rising of the ‘I’-thought is once allowed, it is then no wonder that even God and the <em>Jnani</em> will also appear to be bound by the power of <em>Maya</em>; however, this appearance is false, being only in the view of the illusory ‘I’-thought.</p>
<p id = "para-160">Even in the life of Bhagavan Sri Ramana there were some occasions when it seemed as if He approved of some of the foolish ideas of worldly-minded people, and as if He abided by the unnecessary conditions imposed by them. All these matters, however, only appeared so in the view of the ignorant.</p>
<p id = "para-161"><b>105.

<p id = "para-165">The sun does not plan or order that living beings should work, but, each in his own way, makes use of the presence of the sun to do as they wish. So also, the Presence of God (i.e., the Presence of Self) is used by the mind of each person in his own way, either to do <em>karmas</em> and be bound by them, or to inquire into Being and be liberated. Just as the activities of nature cannot continue without the sun, so the five-fold phenomenon cannot function without the Grace (i.e. The Presence) of God or Self.</p>

<p id = "para-177"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Those schools of thought, such as <em>Dwaita</em> and <em>Vishishtadwaita</em>, which say that world and <em>jiva</em> are real, should accept that they are thus degrading God as a partial reality, or else they should give up their dualistic ideas.</p>

<p id = "para-187"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In the above two stanzas Sri Bhagavan advises us that it is foolish to try to know about our past births. Both pain and pleasure are mere thoughts, originating from the root ‘I’-thought, which is misery itself; hence, since no true happiness can come from misery, to forget the pain and pleasures of the past is alone bliss.</p>
<p id = "para-188"><b>12 Individuality</b></p>
<p id = "para-189"><b>118. Individual Gods and Goddesses and their particularpowers will appear to be real only in the imagination of those minds which admire them. Such mental delusion is at all times completely non-existent for Self, which transcends the mind.</b></p>
<p id = "para-190"><b>119. It is only due to the false sense-bound knowledge ofthe ignorant that they say that <em>Muktas</em> who have realized the Truth have individuality [<em>vyakti</em>]. Truly, universality [<em>avyakti</em>] is the real state of a <em>Jnani</em>, whose nature is the Expanse of Consciousness; the individuality seen in Him by devotees is a reflection of their own individuality.</b></p>
<p id = "para-191"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse it is stressed that people who say, “Not only do we know that the <em>Jnani</em> is an individual, but even He feels that He has individuality” are totally wrong; what they see in Him is merely the reflection of their own nature.</p>
<p id = "para-192"><b>120. That which shines in the heart of an earnest aspirantas the Supreme Reality is mere <em>Jnana</em> itself. Why therefore, after the annihilation of the ego, point out “This One is a great <em>Jnani</em>, and that One is another”? Are They merely the bodies?</b></p>
<p id = "para-193"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Appendix 3, ‘Who is a <em>Jnani</em>?’ in <em>The Path of Sri Ramana, Part 1</em>, will explain in more detail this verse and the following two.</p>

<p id = "para-196"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The intention behind Sri Bhagavan’s instructions to us in this verse is that we should each of us see for ourselves whether or not we have the notion of individuality, ignoring the fact that others may call us a <em>Jnani</em> or an <em>ajnani</em>, and that we should try, on this principle, to set ourselves right. This verse is not intended to give us a yardstick with which to measure others as <em>Jnanis</em> or <em>ajnanis</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-197"><b>123. Leaving aside that true Self-Consciousness, which isdevoid of the least feeling of individuality, and displaying any number of <em>siddhis</em>, is a sheer waste. Who but those fools who are incapable of knowing Self, will desire these senseless <em>siddhis</em>?</b></p>
<p id = "para-198"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: A <em>Jnani</em> will not feel himself to be the doer of any <em>siddhis</em> which, according to <em>prarabdha</em>, He may appear to display; they will not therefore make Him proud and happy, and despite them, He will remain as ever, revelling in Self. Refer to verse B2 (169) of this work, which is also verse 15 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> [<em>Reality Revealed in Forty Verses</em>] Supplement.</p>
<p id = "para-199"><b>124. The <em>Jnani</em>, the Formless One who ever abides as the Supreme Self, is a collected totality of all individual <em>siddhis</em>.

<p id = "para-200"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The <em>Jnani</em> is described as ‘the Formless One’.</p>
<p id = "para-201">Since individual <em>siddhas</em>, even if they possess all the eight-fold <em>siddhis</em>, are unable to display them proudly in front of a <em>Jnani</em>, who possesses <em>Atma-Siddhi</em> [i.e., abidance in Self], which is the highest of all <em>siddhis</em>, they are said to be contained within Him. Since the <em>Jnani</em> is the Self of God, from whom <em>siddhas</em> borrow their powers, all <em>siddhis</em> are here said to be His alone.</p>
<p id = "para-202">The <em>Jnani</em> is neither a <em>Murti</em> [i.e., the form of an individual God], nor even an <em>Avatar</em> or <em>Amsa</em> [i.e., an aspect or part] of the <em>Trimurthis</em> [i.e., the three Gods of Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution]. Since the <em>Jnani</em>, the <em>Guru-Murti</em>, is above the <em>Trimurthis</em>, He is described here as Lord Dakshinamurti, the Primal Guru.</p>
<p id = "para-203"><b>13 Association with the Unreal</b></p>
<p id = "para-204"><b>B1. Give up thinking that the loathsome body is ‘I’. Know Self, which is eternal Bliss. Cherishing the ephemeral body as well as trying to know Self is just like using a crocodile as a raft to cross a river.</b></p>
<p id = "para-205"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Some of the verses in this work were composed by Bhagavan himself. They are numbered independently of the main work as B1, B2, B3, etc. The B stands for Bhagavan. This particular verse also appears as verse twelve in <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-206"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The phrase “Cherishing the ephemeral body” is liable to be misunderstood by aspirants; Sri Bhagavan merely intends to give a warning through this verse to those aspirants who believe that, in order to realise Self, they must live a long life in a healthy body. Such people sometimes go to extremes and, calling themselves yogis, waste most of their waking life doing certain yoga practices and preoccupying themselves to the point of hypochondria with a concern about <em>sattvic</em> diet, physical cleanliness, handsome appearance, good health and so on. These foolish people, as a result, are merely a trouble to their benefactors and useless parasites on society.</p>
<p id = "para-207">However, Bhagavan does not intend to deny the necessity or wisdom of taking a reasonable and moderate care of physical needs. A wise shopkeeper’s aim should not be merely to pay the rent on his shop, but should be to earn a large profit on top of the rent; similarly, an aspirant’s aim should not be merely to provide food, clothing and shelter [the rent] for his body [the shop], he must remember that his business in this body is Self-enquiry, and his aim is to make the worthy profit of Self-Knowledge. However, if the rent is not paid for this body, the business cannot thrive. On the other hand, however, paying the rent [i.e., providing these necessities] should not become the sole endeavour of our whole life; the major portion of our attention must be aimed directly at attaining Self-Knowledge, while attending to a bare minimum of the necessities. Excessive anxiety about the physical necessities of life is like clinging to a crocodile which, instead of acting as a raft to help us cross the river of <em>samsara</em>, will swallow us, making all our futile efforts come to nothing.</p>
<p id = "para-208"><b>125. Those who show great care and love for their bodies,while saying that they are trying to know Self, are like one who tries to cross a river, mistaking a crocodile for a log.</b></p>
<p id = "para-209"><b>126. Instead of attending to <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, the subtlest, which is beyond the reach of speech or mind, to spend one’s life attending merely to the welfare of the gross body is just like drawing water with great difficulty from a well in order to water some useless grass [instead of paddy].</b></p>
<p id = "para-210"><b>127. Those who take to the petty life, mistaking the bodyas ‘I’, have lost, so to speak, the great life of unlimited Bliss in the Heart, which is ever waiting to be experienced by them.</b></p>
<p id = "para-211"><b>128. Not knowing that the world in front of them bringsonly great harm, those who take it to be real and a source of happiness will drown in the ocean of birth and death, like one who takes hold of a floating bear as a raft.</b></p>
<p id = "para-212"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If someone has caught hold of a floating bear, without knowing its true nature but hoping that it will serve as a raft, he will find it very difficult to leave it, even when he has discovered his mistake, since the bear will also have caught hold of him; similarly, even though someone has heard from the Guru that the world is a false appearance, he finds it very difficult to leave it aside, because of the tendencies of attraction which he created by his great desire for it, when he took it to be real. Such is the strength of the mind’s attachment to this world!</p>
<p id = "para-213"><b>129. Just as the movements of a vehicle in which one issitting is wrongly taken to be one’s own movements, so also those who do not have Self-Knowledge suffer from the delusion of mistaking the birth and death [i.e., <em>samsara</em>] experience by the ego as their [Self’s] own [birth and death].</b></p>
<p id = "para-214"><b>130. If the ignorant one, who is clinging to the body andworld as real, wants to have peace, he should, giving up his wrong notion, cling like an <em>udumbu</em> to Self in his heart.</b></p>

<p id = "para-216"><b>131. Those who live the life of an ego, desirously entertaining themselves with the pleasures of false sense objects, will be doomed to delusion. The only life worth living is revelling in the Supreme Consciousness – that is, being Self.</b></p>
<h3 id = "link-4">14 The Pandit</h3>
<p id = "para-217"><b>132. Why do many of you call me a <em>Pandit</em>? The correct sign of the real <em>Pandit</em> is the knowledge that the knower of the all the arts and sciences is non-existent, and that all he has learnt throughout the past ages is therefore mere ignorance.</b></p>
<p id = "para-218"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Here Sri Bhagavan is objecting to those who call Him a great <em>Pandit</em> simply because they see in Him poetical genius, fluent knowledge of the scriptures, a wonderful power of memory, sharp intelligence, skill in argument, acquaintance with many languages, medical knowledge, architectural skill, and so on. He denies that one who has learnt all the arts and sciences is a true <em>Pandit</em>. The ego, the wrong knowledge that “I am the body” is itself the primal ignorance, so how can the learning acquired by such ignorance be true knowledge? The knowledge of anything but Self is therefore mere ignorance.</p>
<p id = "para-219">However, Sri Bhagavan is Himself the true <em>Pandit</em>, because of His Self-Knowledge. He who is able to discriminate and understand this is alone fit to take to Self-enquiry and gain Self-Knowledge, thus qualifying himself to be called a true <em>Pandit</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-220"><b>133. Enquiring, “Who is this ‘I’ that has learnt all thesearts and sciences?”, and thereby reaching the Heart, the ego vanishes along with all its learning.

<p id = "para-221"><b>134. Those who have learnt to forget all that was learnt,and to abide within, are alone the Truth-Knowers. Others, who remember everything, will suffer with anxiety, being deluded by the false <em>samsara</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-222"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The knowledge of all the sixty-four arts and sciences are nothing but the fruit of thinking, and thinking and forgetting are properties of the mind, which is lost in the State of Self-Knowledge, where Oneness prevails and where neither remembering nor forgetting take place.

<p id = "para-223"><b>135. O scholar, you who bow your head in shame in frontof a <em>Jnani</em> when He asks you, “Oh, poor soul, who are you that has learnt all [these arts and sciences]?”, may your ignorant mind be damned.</b></p>
<p id = "para-224"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The strong-sounding words used here by Sri Bhagavan – “may your ignorant mind be damned” – should be understood to be a blessing rather than a curse, since the aim of the aspirant is the damnation (i.e., the total annihilation) of his own mind. Refer also to <em>Upadesa Manjari</em> [<em>Spiritual Instruction</em>] Chapter 1, Question 4.</p>
<p id = "para-225"><b>136. One who is permanently established in Self-Consciousness – having destroyed delusion, which is in the form of doubt and misunderstanding – is the Supreme <em>Pandit</em>.</b></p>

<p id = "para-233"><b>141. After knowing that the purport at the heart of allscripture is that the mind should be subdued in order to gain Liberation, what is the use in continuously studying them? Who am I?</b></p>

<p id = "para-237"><b>144. To be freed from ignorance by mere studies is asimpossible as the horns of a horse, unless by some means the mind is killed and the tendencies are thus completely erased by the blossoming of SelfKnowledge.</b></p>
<p id = "para-238"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Readers should remember that Bhagavan Sri Ramana recommended Self-enquiry and self-surrender as the only two means by which the Truth may be known. The result of both these methods is both <em>mano-nasha</em> [death of the mind] and <em>vasanakshaya</em> [eradication of the tendencies].</p>
<p id = "para-239"><b>145. For the <em>jiva’s</em> weak and unsteady mind, which is ever wavering like the wind, there is no place to enjoy bliss except the Heart, its Source; the study of scriptures is, for it, like a noisy <em>shandai</em> [a cattle fair].</b></p>
<p id = "para-240"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The arts are merely the skilful play of mental modifications [<em>mano-vrittis</em>]; just as flowing rivers roar wildly until reaching their original source, the ocean, where they become peaceful and silent, so also the restlessly moving mind will not find peace and silence until, giving up such <em>vrittis</em>, it returns and abides in its Source. Refer also to verse 8 of <em>Arunachala Ashtakam [The Eight Stanzas to Arunachala]</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-241"><b>146. Rooting out useless sense-desires is possible onlyfor those expert enquirers who, giving up the vast <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Agamas</em>, know through Self-enquiry, the Truth within the Heart.</b></p>
<p id = "para-242"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The phrase <em>‘Vedas</em> and <em>Agamas</em>’ refers to the portion of the scriptures that teaches ritualistic actions for achieving desired ends.</p>
<p id = "para-243"><b>147. Though one learns the blemishless <em>Jnana Sastras</em> perfectly and with great enthusiasm, one has to forget, give up and be free of them when one tries to abide as Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-244"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is necessary to have great enthusiasm for studying during the time of <em>Sravana</em> [i.e., hearing from the scriptures and the Guru], but this desire and enthusiasm will fade away during the time of <em>Manana</em> [i.e., reflection upon these teachings], because the ideas will then lose their novelty owing to one’s complete conviction in them. However, during the time of <em>Nididhyasana</em> [i.e. practice], when the aspirant tries to turn Selfward, he finds that the scriptures learnt by him tend to rise as obstructing thoughts, due to the power of <em>Sastra vasanas</em>. Thus, even the divine scriptures have to be discarded and forgotten, while the aspirant tries to remain alone and merge into the Heart.</p>
<p id = "para-245"><b>17 The Greatness of <em>Vedanta</em></b></p>
<p id = "para-246"><b>148. Worldly people, deluded by sensual pleasures whichlead to destruction, cannot know of the existence of the Truth.

<p id = "para-247"><b>149. The experience of <em>Vedanta</em> is possible only for those who have completely given up all desires. For the desirous it is far away, and they should therefore try to rid themselves of all other desires by the desire for God, who is free from desires.</b></p>
<p id = "para-248"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The term <em>Vedanta</em> is commonly understood to mean a particular system of philosophy, but its true meaning is the experience of <em>Jnana</em> which is gained as the conclusion [<em>anta</em>] of the <em>Vedas</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-249">The desire for sense objects, which are all 2nd or 3rd persons, is directly opposed to the desire for God, and so it is quite clear that God is not merely one among the many 2nd and 3rd personal objects, but that He must be the Reality of the 1st person. Therefore, we should understand that discarding all desires for 2nd and 3rd personal objects and having love for Self alone is the true devotion towards God. Verse B13 [731] also asserts this same point.</p>
<p id = "para-250"><b>18 The Workings of <em>Prarabdha</em></b></p>
<p id = "para-251"><b>150. The Wise, who know that all worldly experiences areformed by <em>prarabdha</em> alone, never worry about their life’s requirements. Know that all one’s requirements will be thrust upon one by <em>prarabdha</em>, whether one wills them or not.</b></p>
<p id = "para-252"><b>151. Every <em>jiva</em> experiences his own <em>prarabdha</em>, which is catalysed by the mere Presence of Shiva as the Witness dwelling in the heart of each one.

<p id = "para-256"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The immaturity referred to here is the lack of the desire to abandon the ego, because liberation can never be attained without <em>bhakti</em>, which is the strong yearning in the aspirant to lose his ego. Thus this verse could more fittingly be included in chapter 21 ‘<em>The Power of Vasanas</em>’. Or with verse 605 in <em>Apaka Tiran</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-257"><b>153. Why is it that, even if one wishes, it is not possible toachieve the eight-fold <em>siddhis</em> as well as Self-Knowledge? Because wealth and wisdom, being contrary to each other, will not generally be gained together in this world.</b></p>
<p id = "para-258"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: If <em>siddhis</em> appear together with <em>Jnana</em>, they are due to the <em>kamya karmas</em> performed in a previous life-time, while the individual was still in the dark grips of ignorance. Thus, since <em>siddhis</em> are according to <em>prarabdha</em> [one of the three <em>karmas</em>, which are all based upon the ego], and since <em>Jnana</em> destroys the ego, it is opposed to <em>siddhis</em>. Moreover, as <em>Jnana</em> is based upon Self and not upon the ego, it is not bound by any of the three <em>karmas</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-259"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Therefore it is not necessarily true, as some say, that all <em>siddhas</em> should be <em>Jnanis</em> and all <em>Jnanis</em> should have siddhis, or, as some others say, that <em>siddhas</em> cannot be <em>Jnanis</em> and <em>Jnanis</em> cannot have <em>siddhis</em>.</p>

<p id = "para-264"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Small creatures, trying to climb out of the dangerous eddies of a stream, are sometimes pushed back again by mischievous boys; this is used as a simile for those <em>jivas</em> who, while trying to cling to Self-Attention, find themselves being constantly pulled back by their <em>vasanas</em> into <em>samsara</em>, the eddying stream of worldly thoughts.</p>

In a cinema picture showing the scene of a royal court, the king is seen viewing his court; just as he appears to be a seer, though in fact he is one of the insentient pictures [i.e., the seen], so also the <em>jiva</em> appears to be a seer viewing the world, though in fact he is also one of the insentient pictures projected on the screen of Self.

<p id = "para-276"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the rising of the ego is the root of all pride, it is the only obstruction to our being a truly humble slave and servant to God, and therefore its annihilation is the only true sign of a real <em>Bhakta</em> [Devotee] or <em>Karma Yogi</em>. Since the ego is itself the root and the primal form of ignorance, its annihilation alone is the Supreme <em>Jnana</em>. Since the ego [i.e., the feeling ‘I am the body’] is the cause of the feeling of separation from God, its annihilation alone is the true <em>Yoga</em> [i.e., union with God]. Since the ego is the root and the primal form of wretchedness, its annihilation is the only true manifestation of blessed Grace. It is thus shown that the aim of all the four <em>Yogas</em> is the annihilation of the ego.</p>

<p id = "para-278"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The true <em>Sannyasa</em> is the renunciation of the ego and the true Brahminhood is the realization of <em>Brahman</em> [i.e., the Self], and thus both the words <em>Sannyasin</em> and <em>Brahmin</em> mean one who has destroyed the ego. But as <em>ashramas</em> [orders of life] and <em>varnas</em> [castes] pertain only to the body, only those who identify themselves with their bodies can feel that they belong to the highest <em>ashrama</em> [known as <em>Sannyasa</em>] or to the highest <em>varna</em> [known as Brahminhood]. Such feelings naturally create pride and strengthen the ego, and therefore the higher the <em>ashrama</em> or <em>varna</em>, the heavier the burden of the ego, and the harder its eradication.</p>

<p id = "para-282"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: At times Sri Bhagavan used to reveal some information which was not given by the scriptures and <em>Puranas</em> such as:</p>
<p id = "para-283">a) how, in the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, Sri Krishna began His teachings with the doctrines of <em>Ajata</em> and <em>Advaita</em>, but then condescendingly came down to various stages of <em>Dwaita</em>, and how He carefully used words which, though suited to Arjuna’s limited grasping power, also gives room for well-ripened aspirants to discover, even now, the motive behind those words.</p>
<p id = "para-284">b) how at first, Sri Dakshinamurti answered His disciples’doubts with wise and convincing replies before he took to his method of teaching through Silence.</p>
<p id = "para-285">c) the following variation on the story of Kannappa: Kannappa was proud of his eyes, which were very beautiful, so, according to the divine saying, “I will forcibly deprive my true devotee of all his possessions so that his mind may always cling to me”, Lord Shiva tested Kannappa by making him offer even his treasured and enviable eyes to the Lord. Thus even his slight attachment to his body was removed and he was absorbed in Shiva.</p>
<p id = "para-286">As this information about Kannappa’s attachment to his beautiful eyes was not revealed by the <em>Puranas</em>, but only by Sri Bhagavan Ramana, we can infer that He is none other than Shiva, who faced Kannappa at that time.</p>
<p id = "para-287">This information about Kannappa, which continues in the next verse also, was gathered by Sri Muruganar. The information about Sri Krishna’s teaching was recorded in verse 101 of this same work, and also in <em>Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi</em>, talk, nos. 264, 364 and 611. The information about Sri Dakshinamurti’s verbal teaching has not been recorded elsewhere so the reader may ask Sri Bhagavan’s early devotees for the full story.</p>
<p id = "para-288"><b>Editor’s note</b>: These words were written more than twenty years ago. Since that time the story of Dakshinamurti has appeared in <em>The Mountain Path</em>, 1982, pp. 11-12. It will also appear in a few months in <em>Padamalai</em>, in the chapter of ‘The Guru’.</p>

<p id = "para-307">Are there not among us some aspirants who, seeing the sufferings in this world, make efforts to reform it or even to heavenize it?

<p id = "para-308"><b>174. One’s fear and quaking of one’s body while one isentering <em>samadhi</em> is due to the slight ego-consciousness still remaining.

<p id = "para-309"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The annihilation of the ego is alone the realization of Self, so when an aspirant’s attachment to his body is being removed through enquiry, he [i.e. the ego] will feel that he is going to die, hence some aspirants experience during their <em>sadhana</em> a fear of death and sometimes even a physical shaking or great heat, and so in this verse Sri Bhagavan clears the aspirant’s doubts and explains these phenomena.</p>
<p id = "para-310"><b>175.

<p id = "para-314"><b>177.

<p id = "para-315"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The rising of an individual ‘I’ [ego or <em>jiva</em>] is the reason why Self is seen as many things. Therefore, since it seems to spoil the true Oneness of Self, the ego’s rising is considered to be treason against Self.</p>
<p id = "para-316"><b>26</b> <b>Heaven and Hell</b></p>
<p id = "para-317"><b>178. O men, do not argue and quarrel amongst yourselvesabout the reality of heaven and hell. As long as and as far as this present world is real, till then and to that extent heaven and hell are also real.</b></p>
<p id = "para-318"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Many of us take great interest in arguing about the reality and existence of other worlds such as heaven and hell, and whether or not they are mere mytho-poetic imaginations. Sri Bhagavan, however, points out that all such arguments are based on a false premise, namely the reality of our own existence. “As the eye, so is the sight”: Hence, believing oneself, the seer, to be real we conclude that the world, the seen, is also real. But only when, through Self-Knowledge we find the seer to be unreal, can we truly know that this and all other worlds are also unreal. Until then we have no true premise on which to judge the reality of this or of other worlds, and, therefore, it is right to concede the same degree of reality to all worlds, whether seen or unseen, as we give to the seer of them.</p>
<p id = "para-319"><b>179 If those geniuses who assert, “Yes, this world and body which we see do really exist,” would sit and scrutinize [this matter] with me, I would certainly point out to them, “Yes, not only does this world really exist, but also do other worlds such as heaven and hell!”</b></p>
<p id = "para-320"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Even scientists have nowadays come to understand that the things which we perceive through the five senses cannot be said to exist objectively in the same manner as they appear to us, and that, because the senses cannot reveal things as they really are, it is wrong to believe the senses and to decide the world exists as we see it.</p>
<p id = "para-321">In this verse, although those who assert the reality of this world are ironically called geniuses by Sri Bhagavan, why, instead of advising them that the world is unreal, does He join them in saying that it is real? There are two reasons why even <em>Jnanis</em>, who have realised the world-appearance to be illusory, say that the world is real:</p>
<p id = "para-322">1) The <em>Jnani</em> never sees Himself as an unreal and insignificant <em>jiva</em>, but only as the real, unlimited and pure Awareness. Since His outlook is that of <em>Brahman</em>, He will say according to the saying “As the eye, so is the sight” – that the universe is real.</p>
<p id = "para-323">2) If the truth were told that this world and the others, such as heaven and hell, are all unreal, the ignorant, who do not know the Absolute Truth [due to the power of their <em>vasanas</em>, in the form of worldly desires], would lose all fear of doing evil actions and all interest in doing <em>punya karmas</em> [meritorious actions]. So, it is in the best interest of the ignorant that they should be told that evil actions done in this world will take them to hell and virtuous actions will take them to heaven.</p>
<p id = "para-324">Therefore, while the modern mind takes the present world and the incidents happening here to be real, it is definitely wrong for anyone to believe that all the worlds and incidents mentioned in the <em>Puranas</em> are unreal, or for anyone to say that we may regard these things as mere ‘mytho-poetic’ imaginations.</p>

<p id = "para-328"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: A thorough scrutiny will reveal that the nature of misery is the rising of ‘I’, the ego, since no misery is experienced in deep sleep, where there is no rising of the ego. The way to eradicate misery is therefore to not allow the rising of the ego, which can only be prevented by vigilant Self-attention. Hence, the enquiry “Who am I?” is the only means to end all misery.</p>
<p id = "para-329"><b>28 The Conquest of Hell (Naraka)</b></p>
<p id = "para-330"><b>181. The <em>Puranas</em> say that Lord Narayana has killed the demon [of misery], Naraka Asura.

<p id = "para-331"><b>182. The <em>Deepavali</em>-bath, which is taken by all people on the fourteenth moon in remembrance of the conquest of Naraka, signifies the bath of <em>Jnana</em>, which is taken after destroying the ego Naraka Asura, by searching for his source.</b></p>
<p id = "para-332"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: <em>Deepavali</em> or <em>Naraka Chaturdasi</em> is an annual festival celebrated in India on the fourteenth day of the waning moon in October or November.

<p id = "para-333">The above two verses were summarised in the following verse by Sri Bhagavan:</p>

<p id = "para-336"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: <em>Deepavali</em> means the “Festival of Lights”. The above verse which explains the significance of the “Lights” [i.e. the firecrackers used on that day] was rewritten as follows by Sri Bhagavan with only a slight change in the meaning, but in poetry which was clearer and more beautiful because of the precision of each syllable.</p>
<p id = "para-337"><b>B5. <em>Deepavali</em> signified the shining of Self after the destruction, through enquiry, of the greatest sinner, Naraka [the ego], who took the abode of this filthy body, which is the form of hell, as ‘I’.</b></p>

<p id = "para-344"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The terms “inward” and “outward” can be used only in reference to the body, but as the body is itself a mere imagination, such terms should not be taken literally. The reason for the use of these words is that the aspirant, in his ignorance, feels his body to be ‘I’, so on being told to “turn inwards” he should understand that the should “turn Selfwards,” that is he should turn his attention towards what he feels as “I”. In truth, Self is neither inside nor outside the body as it alone exists beyond all limitations such as time and space.</p>
<p id = "para-345"><b>187. O mind, it is not wise for you to come out [in the formof thoughts]; it is best to go within. Hide yourself deep within the Heart and escape from the tricks of <em>Maya</em>, who tries to upset you by drawing you outwards.</b></p>

However, since this worship is mere mental activity it cannot be counted as the highest and true <em>Shiva puja</em> mentioned in verses 204 and 205 above.

Indeed to treat and love a body as ‘I’ is the primal mistake which leads to all other forms of idol worship. So it is clear that we are all idol-worshippers, even if we take pride in scorning those that worship temple idols. As long as one takes one’s body as ‘I’, there is no wrong in also worshipping an idol as God, and until one feels that it is wrong to treat one’s body as ‘I’, one should not be scornful and criticize others for treating an idol as God. If one first roots out and destroys the ‘I am the body’ notion, one is then in a position to criticize idol worship, if such criticism is necessary [in the light of <em>Jnana</em> such criticism will of course be clearly seen as unnecessary].</p>

<p id = "para-392"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Vibhuti</em> is prepared by burning cowdung in an airtight oven.

<p id = "para-398"><b>214. The reason why the <em>Puranas</em> describe the bull taken by Shiva as His vehicle and similar creatures [taken by other Gods] is to gradually cultivate in us a habit of viewing all manifest forms as God, their Substratum.</b></p>

<p id = "para-400"><b>215. Nothing is impossible for Power of Self, which is thepower of the Almighty’s Grace. Some people say “It is possible only through the power of sword and shield”, because of the dirty nature of <em>Maya</em>, the notion “I am the filthy body”.</b></p>
<p id = "para-401"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse explains the success achieved through the divine power of non-violence during India’s fight for freedom.</p>
<p id = "para-402"><b>216. Those that say that Power and Peace are different donot know them rightly. What prevails internally as Peace is expressed externally as Power.</b></p>
<p id = "para-403"><b>B6. What is experienced as Peace while [the mind is] inward turned, is experienced as Power while [it is] outward turned. Only <em>Jnanis</em> who have deeply enquired and realised [the true nature of Self prevailing during both introversion and extroversion] know that Peace and Power are one and the same.</b></p>
<p id = "para-404"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: There is a saying, “Which is more difficult, to build a dam and control the flood, or to breach the dam and release the flood?” To arrest the mind, which by habit wanders outside with great force, and to keep it peacefully within the Heart, the Supreme Power of Grace is needed; but to release the mind, and so allow it to create [i.e., to conceive] and see innumerable worlds externally, only a slight allowance of that Supreme Power is needed. Therefore, the powers of creation and sustenance are but a tiny reflection of that Supreme Power of Peace within. If an aspirant can understand this, he will surely no longer feel any delight or wonder in acquiring the eightfold <em>siddhis</em> and the power to create and sustain whole universes.</p>
<p id = "para-405"><b>217. The power to punish others in many ways can befound in one who has cultivated a noble character and virtuous behaviour; but having the greatest forbearance is the only true sign of having really achieved Godhood.</b></p>
<p id = "para-406"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Rather than possessing outward powers to punish others, the true and greatest power is to be inwardly at Peace, and thus to be able to bear with and forgive others. Thus this verse confirms the ideas of the previous verse.</p>

<p id = "para-408"><b>218. When the opposite poles of a large magnet and asmall one are joined, the small one, by gaining the greater power of the large one, becomes one with it and shares the same properties.</b></p>
<p id = "para-409"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse a simile is used, without it being explained. The large magnet is a simile for <em>Mahat</em> [i.e., God or Self], the small one is a simile for <em>Anu</em> [i.e., <em>jiva</em> or ego], and their opposite poles are God’s feet and the <em>jiva’s</em> head. Joining their opposite poles, therefore, means that the <em>jiva</em> bows down and places his head beneath the Feet of God, and thus loses his individuality by merging in God, and becomes God Himself. That is, when the petty ego merges with Self through self-surrender it shines as the Supreme Self Itself.</p>

<p id = "para-413"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The phrase ‘<em>Atma-Siddha-Loka</em>’ [the world of <em>AtmaSiddhas</em>] may be interpreted in a number of ways; its principle meaning must be Self, as all <em>Atma-Siddhas</em> are Self and nothing but Self, and in their view there is certainly no <em>loka</em> or world other than Self.</p>
<p id = "para-414">It may also mean the physical presence of the Guru or <em>Atma-Jnani</em>, in which case this verse is a reference to those unfortunate souls who, despite being blessed with the company of Bhagavan Ramana, left Him due to their greed for <em>siddhis</em>. “After arriving in <em>Atma-Siddha-Loka</em>” may alternatively mean, “though the ego dwells under the mercy of the ever-attained <em>[Nitya-Siddha]</em> Self”.</p>

This being so, tell me how can those who yoke their mind to <em>siddhis</em> which are unobtainable without mental efforts, drown in the Bliss of Liberation which is the complete cessation of mental activities?</b></p>
<p id = "para-418"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Refer also to <em>The Call Divine</em>, vol. IV p. 401. This verse is in <em>Collected Works</em> as verse sixteen of <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-419"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse reveals that without ‘<em>chitta-chalana</em>’ [i.e., mental activities] no <em>siddhis</em> can be performed. However, the <em>siddhis</em> which are apparently performed by a <em>Jnani</em>, whose mind is dead, are different because they are caused by the Will of God, and the <em>Jnani</em> therefore feels no sense of doership [i.e., He does not feel that He Himself performs them]. Hence, we should know that a <em>Jnani</em> performs <em>siddhis</em> without any mental activities, and that one who, on the other hand feels “I am doing, I will do, or I can do <em>siddhis</em>” is certainly not a <em>Jnani</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-420"><b>223. O man, the most wonderful <em>siddhi</em> is that you, who are really pure formless Self-Consciousness, take the body with its legs and hands as ‘I’ and go dancing about as if real; [compared to this] even the eight kinds of <em>siddhis</em> are no real wonders.</b></p>
<p id = "para-421"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: “ …go dancing about as if real…” refers to the ego thinking that it performs <em>karmas</em> and undergoes many births and deaths.</p>
<p id = "para-422"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: By referring to man as “pure”, it is pointed out that he is not any of the impure attributes such as mind; by referring to him as “formless”, it is pointed out that he is not any form such as the body; by referring to him as Self-Consciousness it is pointed out that he is not some inert matter such as the corpse-like body. But since We are able to apparently change ourselves into all these things [i.e. ego] which are directly opposed to our true nature, this is said by Sri Bhagavan to be the most wonderful of <em>siddhis</em>. This <em>siddhi</em> is made still more wonderful since We, the motionless Self, having become an ego then perform actions and undergo many births and deaths. Thus, Sri Bhagavan points out that, more wonderful than any of the eightfold <em>siddhis</em>, is this <em>siddhi</em> by which the ever-flawless Self appears to become the defective ego.</p>
<p id = "para-423"><b>224. The attainment of Self, which is the Primal Thing, andthe Knowledge of Liberation, is alone the true <em>Jnana-Siddhi</em>. All the other eight types of <em>siddhis</em> belong merely to the wavering mind and its power of imagination.</b></p>

<p id = "para-425"><b>225. Immortality is reserved only for those who have diedinto their ego, the filthy empty sense “I am the body”, which veils their immortal nature of <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, the only beloved Thing.</b></p>
<p id = "para-426"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Some misguided aspirants take to various kinds of yogas to prevent the body’s death or at least to lengthen its life, in the false belief that that is immortality. Taking pity on such people, Sri Bhagavan here clearly defines true Immortality.</p>
<p id = "para-427"><b>226. Because of the delusion that the alien body is ‘I’, birthand death seem to befall us. Therefore, immortality, our true nature, is achieved only when this delusion is completely removed.</b></p>
<p id = "para-428"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Birth and death only befall the body, but taking the body to be ‘I’ we feel “I am born, and I will die”. If we wish to become immortal we therefore merely have to cast off this illusory identification with the body, and we will then realise that we are the Ever-Unborn and Ever-Immortal Self.</p>
<p id = "para-429"><b>227. Death is nothing but the delusion that “I am the alienbody”, and Immortality is nothing but the Bliss that is gained when that delusion dies through the knowledge of the non-dual Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-430"><b>228. Can immortality be obtained unless the one whotakes this body as ‘I’ dies as Self, having become afraid of this body’s death and having, therefore, enquired “Who is this I?” [No.]</b></p>
<p id = "para-431"><b>229. Know and accept that Immortality is only the shiningof the true Clarity [i.e. pure Consciousness], without the delusion of mental modifications. Death cannot be overcome by anything other than that Pure Consciousness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-432"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: As death is the result of ignorance, it is said in this verse that it can be overcome only by Knowledge, the Pure Consciousness of Self.</p>
<h3 id = "link-5">43 KayaandKalpa</h3>
<p id = "para-433"><b>230. To name a transient and illusory thing which is bornto die, as <em>Kaya</em> is simply a polite mockery. Only Self-Consciousness, which is found to be the Ultimate Truth, is permanent [<em>Kaya</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-434"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: <em>Kaya</em> literally means permanent, but it has come to mean in common usage the body.</p>

<p id = "para-436"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Yogis generally use the word <em>Kalpa</em> to mean the elixir for lengthening the body’s life, but Sri Bhagavan points out with this verse that the true <em>Kalpa</em> is Self-Knowledge.</p>
<p id = "para-437"><b>44 The Attainment of Bodily Immortality</b></p>
<p id = "para-438"><b>232. Only those who do not know that the body is theroot-disease which gives birth to all other diseases will perform <em>tapas</em> to achieve bodily immortality, instead of trying to root out this disease; such people are like one who toils hard to water mere weeds.</b></p>
<p id = "para-439"><b>233. Only those worthless people whose form is the poisonous and non-existent ego, which is the base of all terrible diseases, will untiringly perform <em>tapas</em> to immortalize the body, like one who takes a medicine to aggravate his disease.</b></p>
<p id = "para-440"><b>234. As a result of prolonged, worthy, and well-performed_tapas_, desiring to stabilize one’s individuality instead of ever-remaining in the Supreme Silence, is due to dense ignorance, like achieving poverty with great longing and struggling.</b></p>
<p id = "para-441"><b>235. For those who see through perfect <em>Jnana</em>, this bodily life is unreal and merely mental, and therefore know that there is only misery and no benefit in <em>jiva’s</em> prolonging their <em>jiva’s</em> lifetime.</b></p>
<p id = "para-442"><b>45 <em>Vairagya</em>(Dispassion)</b></p>
<p id = "para-443"><b>236. Know that people who offer you praise and <em>puja</em> with worldly ambitions, to make your heart swell with joy, are only a golden bait offered by <em>Maya</em> to entice you, who are doing <em>tapas</em> with great <em>vairagya</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-444"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If the praise offered by others gives one even the slightest joy, then like bait, it will cause one’s downfall. Such praise does not, of course, bind a <em>Jnana-Mukta</em>, who has lost his individuality, and so Sri Bhagavan clearly addresses this verse to “you who are doing <em>tapas</em>”.</p>
<p id = "para-445">Many aspirants, even before reaching the goal of Egolessness, are enchanted and deluded by the praise and worship of others, and forgetting the goal, they run after name and fame, and going from place to place, they give teachings, blessings, etc. To save them from such self-ruin, Sri Bhagavan graciously gives these instructions. Just as the bait, though golden, will kill its prey, so also name and fame, though seemingly worth achieving, will ruin the aspirant by strengthening his ego, and will hinder him from reaching the Goal.</p>
<p id = "para-446"><b>237. Supreme <em>Jnana</em> dawns with ease only for those fortunate ones in whose hearts dispassion towards the pleasures of this world and the next springs forth naturally in this birth.</b></p>
<p id = "para-447"><b>238. Know well that the experience of Bliss exists only inSelf and never in this life of delusion, and hence achieve Self-Knowledge, which is the Space of Grace and the final state of Supreme Silence.</b></p>
<p id = "para-448"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em> and <em>Michael James</em></b>: Since space is all-pervading, vast, abundant, and subtle, Sri Bhagavan uses the word ‘Space’ – as in ‘Space of Grace’, ‘Space of Consciousness’, ‘Space of Bliss’ etc., – to denote the idea of all-pervading vastness, abundance, and subtlety, which are all qualities of Self.</p>
<p id = "para-449"><b>239. O my dear friend <em>Vairagya</em> who is always enlightening me with Knowledge by destroying the dense delusion of desire, please do not abandon me who ever claim your friendship.</b></p>
<p id = "para-450"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: To stress the instruction that we should never give up <em>vairagya</em>, it is nicely expressed here in the form of a prayer addressed to <em>Vairagya</em>, which is personified as a friend, asking it never to forsake us.</p>
<p id = "para-451"><b>240. O my virtuous friend <em>Vairagya</em>, when the proverb says, “Friendship, even with a wicked ghost, is difficult to break, once it is made”, if I break my friendship with you who has been protecting me from evil and leading me home during all my past lives, it would be worse than meeting me with the hostility of the whole world.</b></p>
<p id = "para-452"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since it is difficult to break a friendship, even when it is found to be harmful, it is nearly impossible to break one which is known to be beneficial. However, if a beneficial friendship were broken, especially with such a friend as <em>Vairagya</em>, it would be the worst calamity that could befall one.</p>
<p id = "para-453"><b>241. Whatever thought may rise, not to let it live or grow,but to destroy it then and there, without the least slackness, by merging it back into its Source, is powerful and intense <em>Vairagya</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-454"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Formerly, we were taught by the Scriptures that <em>Vairagya</em> is to feel aversion for our desires and to reject them, but now Sri Bhagavan teaches us that true <em>Vairagya</em> is to maintain a vigilant Self-attention by which every thought, instead of being allowed to rise and develop, is turned back and merged into its Source.</p>
<p id = "para-455"><b>242. If, by the wonderful weapon of Self-enquiry, youwould continue destroying, one by one, all the innumerable foes – the <em>vasanas</em> rising in the form of thought – as and when each of them comes out of the fort – <em>chittam</em> – the enemy’s fort will finally be in your hands.</b></p>
<p id = "para-456"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: All the <em>vasanas</em>, which have the collective name of <em>chittam</em>, have their abode in the Heart [refer to <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em> verse 19, <em>Arunachala Ashtakam</em>, verse 7, and verse 249 of this work], so the enemy’s fort which we will capture is nothing but our own home, the Heart.

<p id = "para-459"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Though the world is seen both by the <em>Jnani</em> and the <em>ajnani</em>, the <em>Jnani</em> does not see it as being other than Himself. If, on the other hand, one sees the world as being apart from oneself, one is an <em>ajnani</em> and one is only at the stage of practice, in which case one should view the world as an illusory appearance to be rejected. This practice is <em>vairagya</em>, which is necessary to gain <em>Jnana</em>. Refer also to <em>Who am I?</em></p>
<p id = "para-460"><b>47 The Nature of <em>Chittam</em></b></p>
<p id = "para-461"><b>244.

<p id = "para-462"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The prism remains ever colourless and its red colour is only apparent. To remove the red colour, it is sufficient if the flower is removed, because the prism will then be seen to be colourless as before. Similarly, <em>Chit</em> truly remains ever pure and the impurity of <em>Maya</em> is only apparent. This apparent association of the ever-pure <em>Chit</em> with <em>Maya</em> is known as ‘<em>chittam</em>’ and to remove ‘<em>-tam</em>’ [i.e., <em>Maya</em>], which is merely attention wrongly focused on 2nd and 3rd persons, it is sufficient if attention is focused on the 1st person, because the ‘<em>chittam</em>’ will then be known to be the ever-shining <em>Chit</em>, Shiva.</p>
<p id = "para-463"><b>48 <em>Chitta Suddhi</em> (Purity of Mind)</b></p>

<p id = "para-471"><b>50 The _Jiva’s_Dwelling Place</b></p>
<p id = "para-472"><b>249. The <em>jiva</em> dwells in the Heart, which is beyond mental conception, and his <em>vasanas</em> also dwell there. If, instead, the <em>vasanas</em> dwelt above, in the brain, would they not be destroyed when the brain [i.e. head] is cut off?</b></p>
<p id = "para-473"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Kavyakantha Ganapati Sastri was once arguing with Sri Bhagavan, saying that <em>vasanas</em> dwell in the <em>sahasrara</em> [i.e. the brain], but Sri Bhagavan replied that if that were so, the <em>vasanas</em> would be destroyed and <em>moksha</em> would be attained when a person was beheaded. Moreover, the <em>vasanas</em> must dwell with their possessor, the <em>jiva</em>, whose home, the Heart, must be within the trunk of his body and not within the head, since when a soldier’s head is cut off in battle, his body may continue showing signs of life for some time. Sri Bhagavan, thus concluded that the Life-Centre, which is the dwelling place of the <em>jiva</em> and his <em>vasanas</em>, is the Heart and not the brain.</p>
<p id = "para-474"><b>250. Since the flame of <em>Kundalini</em> rises upwards [from the base of the spine – the <em>mooladhara</em>] and the Nectar flows downwards from the brain [the <em>sahasrara</em>], the target is the Heart, the Life-Centre.</b></p>
<p id = "para-475"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: In the waking state, when world and body-consciousness are felt, the I-consciousness is spread throughout the body, but when Self-attention is practised the I-consciousness begins to withdraw itself. This withdrawal takes place through the channel known as <em>Sushumna Nadi</em>, which stretches from the base of the spine [the <em>mooladhara chakra</em>] to the brain [the <em>sahasrara chakra</em>]. This rise of the I-consciousness through the <em>Sushumna Nadi</em> is known as the rise of <em>Kundalini</em> which is described as a serpent only for the dull beginners in yoga [see <em>Vichara Sangraham</em>, <em>The Compilation on Self-enquiry</em>, Chapter 7]. The I-consciousness having been withdrawn and gathered in the <em>Sahasrara</em>, will then flow down towards its Source the Heart, and the thought-free vacuum thus left in the <em>Sahasrara</em> is felt as bliss. This bliss is known by Yogis as the Nectar and it is felt to be flowing downwards as the I-consciousness descends towards the Heart.</p>
<p id = "para-476"><b>251.

<p id = "para-477"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The phrase ‘whatever centre’ may include any of the six imaginary yogic centres or any other point in the body which may be chosen for the practice of concentration.</p>

<p id = "para-483"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: See also: “The wise man’s Heart is at his right, but a fool’s heart is at his left” [Ecclesiastes X-2].</p>
<p id = "para-484">It is well known to those who understood Sri Bhagavan correctly that, although He said that the Heart is on the right side of the chest, He never advised anyone to meditate on that point in the body. It is unfortunate therefore that some devotees of Sri Bhagavan, having not reflected over verse 22 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em> – “That [Heart] is both inside and outside, yet it exists beyond [the limitations of] both inside and outside” – used to meditate upon the right side of the chest and also recommended others to do so. Because the teaching in verse 261 and 262 of this work have not been recorded in any of Sri Bhagavan’s other works, and because these two verses have not been adequately translated and made available in any language other than Tamil, such a wrong interpretation persists even now and people still continue with this wrong practice. Verse 3 of <em>The Five Verses on the Oneness of Self</em>, which also appears in this work as verse B8, should be referred to and understood here.</p>
<p id = "para-485"><b>255. If Self, the Lord of the soul, did not indisputablyreside on the right side of the chest, why do one and all have the habit of touching only that place [to denote their self], whenever they say ‘I’?</b></p>

<p id = "para-487"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: “That One Single Consciousness, the Space of mere Being” means the unalloyed and simple Consciousness “I am”, and not “I know myself”, and, hence, it is called “mere Being”. Refer to verse 26 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>, “Knowing Self is being Self”.</p>
<p id = "para-488"><b>257. Heart, the Source, is the beginning, the middle, andthe end of all. Heart, the Supreme Space, is never a form, It is the Light of Truth.</b></p>

<p id = "para-490"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse says that the mind drowns in the Ocean of Self-Consciousness [<em>Chit</em>], which is the real ‘I’ [<em>Sat</em>] and the Ocean of Bliss [<em>Ananda</em>]. Hence, the subtle manner in which this verse is phrased gives the implication that WE are the Ocean of <em>Sat-ChitAnanda</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-491"><b>259. You [the mind] cannot cognize Self, which is the perfect unbroken Existence and the One without a second. The Heart, <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, which is the same thought-free Self, is Annamalai.</b></p>
<p id = "para-492"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since even the gods Brahma and Vishnu were unable to know the top or bottom of Arunachala [the blazing column of Self-Consciousness], It is named, in Tamil, <em>Annamalai</em>, which means “Unattainable Hill”. Thus, when even the gods cannot cognize Self, the mind cannot do so either; that is to say neither the gods nor the mind can know their Source unless first they merge into it and lose their individuality [i.e., unless, by remaining as Self, they cease to be gods or mind].</p>
<p id = "para-493"><b>260. He who knows that Heart will never be ruined; havinglost the sense of bondage, He becomes the Supreme. He is free from the thoughts of duality and He alone enjoys, without delusion, the real Bliss.</b></p>
<p id = "para-494"><b>261. Though the Heart is said to be both inside and outside, it truly exists neither inside nor outside, because the appearance of the body, which is the base of the difference ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, is itself a mental conception.</b></p>
<p id = "para-495"><b>262. While the body is [in fact] in Self, one who thinks thatSelf [or Heart] is within the insentient body is like one who thinks that the screen – which is the substratum of that cinema picture – is contained within the picture.</b></p>
<p id = "para-496"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The translation of B8, which appears here in the original Tamil text, is the same as the translation of verse 262 above, but in its Tamil original Bhagavan has improved upon the style of the previous verse. This verse also appears as verse 3 of <em>Ekatma Panchakam (The Five Verses on the Oneness of Self).</em></p>
<p id = "para-497">The screen is the substratum on which all pictures appear and disappear and in a similar way Self is the substratum in which the picture of this whole universe including the body is contained. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that Self is within the body. Sri Bhagavan uses this simile to drive home the point that, just as the screen is real and the pictures are unreal, Self is the Reality and the pictures of the mind, body and universe are unreal. How, therefore, can the Real be contained in the unreal?</p>
<p id = "para-498">Suppose a pot made of ice were immersed deep in the sea, would it not be wrong to say that the water is contained only within the pot? In fact, the water is both inside and outside, and even the pot itself is only water. Similarly, the Realised One knows that Self alone exists, and that there can be no question of It existing inside or outside the body, since the body and the whole universe are nothing apart from Self. This undiluted truth exists even in the state of ignorance, though the ignorant are unaware of it. ‘Inside’ and ‘outside’ are only in reference to the body, so when the body is found to be unreal, how can the limitations of ‘inside’ or ‘outside’ be applicable? Therefore, Self, the Reality, should not be conceived as being in any way contained within the body.</p>
<p id = "para-499"><b>263. Therefore, only the <em>Jnani</em> – who has seen the death of the ego which is in the form of the notion ‘I am the body’ – will, with His sharp, subtle, and divine outlook, which is completely freed from delusion, see the Heart everywhere and attain greatness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-500"><b>264. The Heart, where the Supreme Silence of God’s Graceis shining, is the only state of <em>Kaivalyam</em>, in the Presence of which the rare pleasure of all the heavens are revealed to be nothing.</b></p>
<p id = "para-501"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: <em>Kaivalyam</em> is the state of Supreme Oneness.</p>
<p id = "para-502"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Sri Bhagavan used to compare all the pleasures available in the celestial worlds, including even <em>Brahma Loka</em>, to the tiny specks of moonlight which fall on the ground through the dense foliage of a large tree, whereas the <em>Jnani’s</em> experience of Bliss is like the full moon-shine in an open space.</p>
<p id = "para-503"><b>265. The Heart, which shines pure after the eradication ofwavering [tendencies] and veiling [delusion], and which remains as the One Truth, is the Supreme <em>Atma-Loka</em> for which even the gods of heaven are longing.</b></p>
<p id = "para-504"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: <em>Atma-Loka</em> simply means Self, and it is here called a ‘<em>loka</em>’ (i.e., world) in order to compare the Bliss of Self with the pleasures of celestial <em>lokas</em>. Since even the gods in the celestial <em>lokas</em> (such as <em>Swarga Loka</em> and <em>Brahma Loka</em>), though they are enjoying the greatest pleasures, are still longing for the Bliss of Self, these celestial <em>lokas</em> are worthless.</p>

<p id = "para-506"><b>266. The Self-Consciousness which shines after the destruction of the [root] thought – the identification with any one of the [three] bodies as ‘I’ – is, the Almighty Power [<em>Akila Para Shakti</em>] who resides as ‘I’ in the hearts of all created beings.</b></p>
<p id = "para-507"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: It is generally supposed that Omnipotence (<em>Akila Para Shakti</em>) is the power of God who creates and sustains the whole universe and the individuals therein. However, this power of creation and sustenance is merely able to limit ‘I’ to a particular body, but since the true Self-Consciousness experienced by a <em>Jnani</em> destroys this limitation, It is a greater Power. Therefore, Sri Bhagavan points out that the Self-Consciousness of a <em>Jnani</em> is the true <em>Akila Para Shakti</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-508"><b>267. This natural Self-Consciousness of mere Existence,without any sense of duality, is the Supreme Silence, which is glorified [by the scriptures] as the perfection of <em>Jnana</em>, and which cannot be known by the ego, the foolish demon-nature.</b></p>
<p id = "para-509"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The Self-Consciousness referred to here denotes <em>Sat-Chit</em>, and it is described as natural because it is ever-attained, and not something to be newly achieved.</p>
<p id = "para-510">The eight-fold <em>siddhis</em> depend upon the functioning of the ego, which is here said to be a demon nature. These <em>siddhis</em> are, therefore, demonic powers and not divine powers as people generally believe.</p>
<p id = "para-511">In the above two verses no direct mention is made of the guru, but they are given in the beginning of this chapter in order to guide aspirants who are intent upon finding the true Guru. These verses teach that the Omnipotence [<em>Akila Para Shakti</em>] of the Guru lies in His Power to destroy the ego, and that Power is simply His mere Self-Consciousness, and not the ability to perform and display miraculous <em>siddhis</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-512"><b>268. Know and discover that He alone who possessessuch Akila <em>Para Shakti</em> [i.e., the Power of Supreme Silence which consumes all by remaining as mere Existence-Self-Consciousness], is the Real Guru who can by His unlimited Grace merge any soul who comes to Him into the non-dual Self, the <em>Jnana</em> beyond all speech.</b></p>
<p id = "para-513"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The words “any soul” are used to stress the point that even non-human creatures will be given liberation by such a Powerful Guru, as, for example, birds and beasts attained Liberation through the Grace of Bhagavan Ramana. Considering this, even immature human beings must be assured of uplift if they come to such a Real Guru.</p>
<p id = "para-514"><b>269. Truly, perfect discipleship – which is the steadfastSupreme Devotion that flares up with the merging of the ego into the Light of Supreme Stillness [i.e. Self-Consciousness] – is alone the right Guruship. Thus you should know.</b></p>
<p id = "para-515"><b>270. He who turns you towards Self and reveals to you theknowledge of Self, is the Guru. In truth He is Self and He is God. Cling to Him.</b></p>
<p id = "para-516"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: As the whole universe which we see is but a projection of Self, Self alone is God, the real creator of the universe. It is also Self alone that, after maturing the devotee through so many births, takes the form of the human Guru in order to reveal <em>Jnana</em> to him. Thus God, Guru and Self are one and the same.</p>
<p id = "para-517"><b>271. He who gives ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ to those who cometo him is both Yama [Death] and Brahma [the Creator] to them. But the truly divine Guru is the one who proves to them that nothing is to be newly accomplished by them.</b></p>
<p id = "para-518"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The ‘would-be guru’, by ordering those who come to him to perform many actions [<em>Karmas</em>] such as <em>Japa</em> or <em>Dhyana</em>, is only loading a greater burden of new actions upon the aspirants, who come to him for relief, because they are unable to bear the fruits of the actions they have already accumulated in the past. Instead of relieving them, the would-be guru plays the part of Yama [Death] by crushing and killing them with a greater burden of <em>Karmas</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-519">Since individuals have to reap the fruits of their actions through innumerable births, the ‘would-be guru’ plays the part of Brahma [creator], by making them perform more <em>karmas</em> and thus making them take more births in order to reap the fruits of these actions.</p>
<p id = "para-520">However, as the <em>Sadguru</em> knows the truth that Self alone exists without a second, He convinces those who approach Him that they are none other than Self. When, through the power of His Silence, they come to understand this truth, they feel that they have nothing to do, but that they merely have to Be. As doing alone is action [<em>karma</em>] but Being is not, and as it is only <em>karma</em> that brings birth and death, they are relieved form both Brahma and Yama.</p>
<p id = "para-521">Unlike other Gurus who instruct their disciples to do the four yogas [<em>Karma</em>, <em>Raja</em>, <em>Bhakti</em>, or <em>Jnana</em>], Sri Bhagavan Ramana makes us stop doing anything in order to discover, “Who does these yogas?”, and thus He turns our attention towards ‘I’, which is the right clue to keep us quiet. This is the nature of the Real Guru.</p>
<p id = "para-522"><b>272. Since one does not love to listen to the teaching ofthe Supreme Self, which is ever going on in the Heart, one comes out with great enthusiastic delusion. Because of this, one needs a Guru outside.</b></p>

<p id = "para-528"><b>276. The Guru is the One, who removes the sufferings andbestows the Bliss of Liberation upon those who, when they come to Him, are swept away by the force of various <em>karmas</em> done with the attachment of likes and dislikes.</b></p>

<p id = "para-531"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: ‘The false’ in this verse denotes the whole universe, including the ego which sees it. ‘Their truth’ means that which appears to be true in their deluded outlook.</p>
<p id = "para-532">The gross lights of the universe [the sun, moon, fire etc.] are seen by the eyes, the eyes are known by the mind, and the mind borrows light from Self; therefore, the Guru who is Self is said to be the Light to all the gross lights of the universe.

<p id = "para-534"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The nouns and adjectives which are used in the Tamil original in this verse, clearly show that the Supreme <em>Jnana-Guru</em> is the extreme opposite of the worthless and wavering <em>jiva</em>; the word “<em>Guru</em>” has the meaning of greatness and heaviness, whereas the word “<em>laghu</em>”, which is used twice, has the meaning of worthlessness and lightness.</p>
<p id = "para-535"><b>280. Guru, the Lord of <em>Jnana</em>, who is the power of the unlimited greatness of Self, is the Supreme Silence which completely defeats the worthless arguments of those who are stained with the delusion of worldly desires.</b></p>
<p id = "para-536"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If one is defeated by the skill of one’s opponents sharp intellect, the defeat is only temporary, since one continues to feel anger and enmity towards him. However, when the arguments of worldly people are defeated by the <em>Jnana-guru’s</em> Supreme Silence their minds are overwhelmed with Knowledge and Bliss, and so, forgetting their enmity, they feel great love for the Guru; thus, the victory won by Silence is eternal.</p>
<p id = "para-537"><b>281.

<p id = "para-538"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Just as the bright sunlight exposes the non-existence of the snake, which appeared on a rope in the dim twilight, so the Light of the Guru’s clear Self-Knowledge exposes the non-existence of the entire universe, which appeared in the dim light of the <em>jiva’s</em> mind.</p>
<p id = "para-539">When a river merges into the ocean, all its attributes, such as its speed, current and shape, are destroyed, yet not one drop of its substance, the water, is lost. Similarly, when a <em>jiva</em>, “I am so-and-so”, meets the glance of the Guru’s eyes, all his attributes, such as “so-and-so”, are destroyed, yet his substance, the Self-Consciousness <em>[Sat-Chit]</em> “I am”, shines unaffected and alone; therefore it is said that the Guru “kills without killing”.</p>

<p id = "para-541"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Shiva is said to be dancing in the ‘<em>smasana</em>’ [burial ground] but it is impossible to see His Divine Dance until the dance of the many restless ghosts, who are also dancing there, is stopped. Similarly, we are told in this verse that it is impossible to see the Divine Dance of the <em>Sphurana</em>, “I-I” [which is the true significance of the Dance of Nataraja in Chidabaram], until the rebellious mind-ghost, which dances as ‘I’, is beheaded by the Grace of the <em>Sadguru</em>, who has destroyed His own mind.</p>

Just as the sight of a lion appearing in its dream willawaken an elephant from sleep, so also the <em>Darshan</em> of the <em>Sadguru</em> will awaken the disciple from the dream of this present waking state, which is merely an illusion, into the state of <em>Jnana</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-543"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The present waking state is itself an illusory dream; just as a dream can only exist by depending upon the background of sleep [i.e., the loss of waking body-consciousness], so this present dream, our so-called waking state, can only exist by depending upon the background of the sleep of our Self-forgetfulness [i.e., the apparent loss of our natural pure Self-Consciousness].</p>
<p id = "para-544">This ignorance [i.e., our Self-forgetfulness] is a much prolonged sleep, in which innumerable dreams [i.e., our many lives] take place; refer to <em>Ekatma Panchakam [The Five Verses on the Oneness of Self]</em> verse 1, in which Sri Bhagavan expresses this idea.</p>
<p id = "para-545">What is destroyed by the <em>Sadguru</em> is not only the drama of our present waking state, but also the much-prolonged sleep of Self-forgetfulness, which is the background of all these dreams, our many births and deaths.</p>
<p id = "para-546">Just as the lion seen by the elephant in its dream is false, yet its awakening is true, so the name and form of the <em>Sadguru</em> is false [from an absolute viewpoint], yet the Awakening [i.e., the Dawn of Self-Knowledge] caused by Him is very Real. After the elephant wakes up from his dream, he will know that the lion seen by him was not real, and similarly, after the Dawn of Self-Knowledge, it will be known that even the name and form of the <em>Sadguru</em> is not real [i.e., the notion that the <em>Sadguru</em> is other than Self, ‘I’, will be known to be false].</p>

<p id = "para-548"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: This well-known simile, which was first used by Sri Bhagavan in <em>Who am I?</em>, is worth pondering over carefully. A deer caught in the jaws of a tiger would generally be considered to be an object of pity, since it will surely be killed, yet Sri Bhagavan uses this as a simile to console devotees and to assure them that they can never escape from the <em>Sadguru</em>, and will surely be saved by Him. The significance of this simile is made slightly clearer in this verse then in <em>Who am I?</em>, as it is said here that the <em>Sadguru</em> will completely destroy the ego and <em>vasanas</em> of His devotees, thus implying that He is the mighty Tiger who will consume the ego, the root of all misery. So, by means of this peculiar simile, Sri Bhagavan is once more stressing that the only true Salvation is the complete annihilation of the ego or individuality; hence, ‘to be destroyed’ is ‘to be saved’!</p>
<p id = "para-549"><b>285. The disciple’s mind which has soaked in the Light of_Jnana_ – the Feet of the <em>Sadguru</em> – which is abundant like [the light of] the sun, can never be imprinted by the three-fold differences, which appear to exist, as if real, in Self, the Pure Consciousness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-550"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The “three-fold differences” include the triads [e.g. the seer, seen, and seeing], the three states [waking, dream, and deep sleep], the three <em>gunas</em> [<em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>], etc.</p>

<p id = "para-555"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The last two lines of this verse are taken from verse 1100 of <em>Tirukkural</em>.

<p id = "para-558"><b>288. Thinking in the proper manner of the Guru’s Grace,which is beyond expression, and Being Still, remaining unattached to the false [world] appearance in front of us, is alone Blissful.</b></p>
<p id = "para-559"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Sri Bhagavan often used to say “Grace is Self, which shines in everyone as ‘I-I’.” Therefore, “thinking in the proper manner of the Guru’s Grace” is nothing but attending uninterruptedly to Self. In order to show that this Self-attention is nothing but avoiding second and third person attention, it is described here as “remaining unattached to the false world-appearance in front of us”. Remaining in Self-attention by “Being Still” is neither a state of laziness, nor is it remaining like a stone in <em>kashta-samadhi</em> or <em>laya</em>; it is the state of making an uninterrupted effort towards Self-attention. When this state is understood and experienced as our own Natural State, then Self-attention becomes effortless, and that is <em>Sahaja Samadhi</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-560"><b>289. Destroy the stealthy ego, which is the thought “I amthe body”, either by enquiring “Who am I?”, or by melting into nothing by always thinking with love of God’s feet. That which will then remain is the Light of <em>Jnana</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-561"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse clearly shows that the ego can be destroyed only by Self-enquiry or self-surrender. One should destroy the ego by whichever of these two means appeals to one as better and more suitable. Anyhow, the destruction of the ego is alone recommended as being essential.</p>
<p id = "para-562"><b>290. <em>Shanti</em> [i.e., Peace or Bliss], which is loved by everyone, cannot at all be attained by anyone, at any place, at any time, or by any means, unless the mind is subdued by the Grace of the <em>Sadguru</em>.

<p id = "para-565"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This important advice, to withdraw the mind from the five senses and to turn it Selfward, is not given to one and all; it is given only for the benefit of those who wish to save themselves, and not for those who are still vainly hoping to save the world. Such people, who want to save the world, will find no taste for Self-attention, and thus they are not yet fit even to save themselves, let alone to save the world; unless one has first learnt to swim, it is vain and futile to jump into the water to save others.</p>
<p id = "para-566"><b>292. Be assured that That which ever shines [for all] iscertainly the true Existence of Self, “I am”. When the True God is thus realised as one’s own Self, without doubt or misconception, the Supreme Bliss will brim over.</b></p>

<p id = "para-582"><b>301. The <em>uchishtam</em> given by the Guru to the disciple is the enlightening words of instruction, coming from His own Self-Realization; the right manner of partaking of His <em>uchishtam</em> is for the disciple to silently abide in Self, as soon as he hears them.</b></p>
<p id = "para-583"><b>302. After offering the ego – the attachment to the body as‘I’ – as food to the Supreme Whole – the Silent Guru – the attainment, by the disciple, of Self, which remains shining in the heart is the eating of the Guru’s <em>uchishtam</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-584"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The feeling ‘I am so-and-so’ is the ego, but when this is surrendered or offered to the Guru, only the portion ‘so-and-so’ [i.e., the attachment to the body] is removed.

<p id = "para-587"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The emphasis in this verse is that even the words, teachings and writings of a <em>Jnani</em> are not necessary, since His mere existence on earth is itself enough to remove all the sins of the world.</p>

<p id = "para-590"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: In India it is the custom for a housewife to pay formal reverence to her husband by many actions such as always sitting at a lower level than him. In truth however, both of them know that these actions are mere formalities, and that, since they are one in life, she is not really menial or inferior to him. In the same way, even the Self-realised disciple will observe the formalities of outward reverence towards his Guru, even though both of them know that they are, in truth, one in <em>Jnana</em>.</p>

<p id = "para-594"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: “… having Arjuna between Himself and us…” means that Krishna is giving all of us instructions through Arjuna, just as an orator talks to a microphone, although he is truly addressing his speech to his audience.</p>
<p id = "para-595">The two kinds of <em>karmas</em> are <em>punya karmas</em> (meritorious actions) and <em>papa karmas</em> (demeritorious actions).</p>

<p id = "para-598"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: All other ways of worshipping the Guru involve the use of body, speech or mind, and therefore, - unlike the merging of the ego into Self [i.e. <em>Jiva-Brahma-Aikya</em>] – they are such that they cannot be performed always and without a break. Hence, <em>Jiva-Brahma-Aikya</em> is the best way of worshipping the Guru.

<p id = "para-599"><b>310. The great delusion caused by the ignorant ego creates the sense of separateness, which conceives the differences such as Guru-disciple, Shiva-<em>jiva</em>, etc. One’s attainment of the State of Silence, where such a sense of separateness never rises, is the meaningful <em>Namaskaram</em> [i.e. obeisance], which one should make towards one’s Guru.</b></p>

Having destroyed the dualistic sense ‘I am the disciple’ by the great Fire of the Teachings of the _Jnana_Guru, the Lord, the shining of the State of Supreme Silence, devoid of all <em>vasanas</em>, is the true way of worshipping the <em>Sadguru</em>.

<p id = "para-603"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The sense ‘I am a <em>jiva</em> is called <em>jiva-bodham</em>, and its destruction is generally known as <em>Shiva-Bodham</em>. Similarly, the destruction of the <em>sishya-bodham</em> [the sense ‘I am a disciple’] is called, in this and other verses, <em>Guru-Bodham</em>. Thus <em>Guru-Bodham</em> simply means <em>Atma-Jnana</em>, the State of Self-Knowledge.</p>
<p id = "para-604">In this state, both the individual sense of the first person, ‘I am so-and-so’, and the sense of otherness [second and third persons such as the Guru] are not experienced.

<p id = "para-605"><b>313.

<p id = "para-611"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: This verse clearly teaches us the true nature of the Guru; He is not the limited human form, He is the unbroken, single, all-pervading Consciousness.</p>
<p id = "para-612">The ego’s outlook is said to be sinful because of the great sin which it commits by dividing and seeing the one real <em>Sat-ChitAnanda</em> as many unreal names and forms of the universe.</p>

<p id = "para-614"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Dattapahara</em> is the crime of taking back what has already been given.</p>
<p id = "para-615">So long as a disciple feels ‘I am the body’ and ‘this is my body’, he cannot be considered to be one who has surrendered himself to the Guru. Instead, he should be considered to be one who has stolen the things which he has already given to another. In short, annihilation of the ego is the complete self-surrender, and that alone is the right <em>Guru-puja</em> [worship of the Guru].</p>
<p id = "para-616"><b>318. The subsidence of the mind’s mischief – of leavingthe Feet of the <em>Sadguru</em>, who has taken one as His own by once subduing the three-fold fire, and of straying away into the fiery desert of sense-pleasures – and its merging [into Self], is the worthy worship to be performed to the Lotus-Feet of the Guru.</b></p>
<p id = "para-617"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: ‘The three-fold fire’ is the three kinds of desire namely for women, wealth and fame.</p>
<p id = "para-618">When a ripe soul first meets his <em>Sadguru</em>, he at once feels, even without any effort on his part, a great peace in his heart and the removal of all worldly desires; this is due to the power of the Grace which prevails in the <em>Sadguru’s</em> presence. This experience is the right sign by which one can know that the <em>Sadguru</em> has taken one as His own. This feeling of peace may either remain in one permanently or temporarily, according to the degree of one’s maturity, but whichever is the case, there is no doubt that this is the sign that one has been brought under the protection of the Guru’s Grace. In the hearts of the less mature souls, the desirelessness and peace, which have once been induced by the Guru’s Grace, will seem to fade away after a while, and his mind will seem to desire worldly things (refer to <em>Maharshi’s Gospel</em> Book I, chapter 3, p. 18), but the disciple need not get disheartened, thinking that he has been abandoned by the Guru. Just as a deer can never escape once it has been caught in the jaws of a tiger, so also, those who have been taken by the Guru as His own will never be abandoned, but will surely be saved. It is only as the result of Grace that all the hidden worldly <em>vasanas</em> in the disciple’s heart are now churned and brought up to the surface of his mind, in order to be destroyed by the power of discrimination which is bestowed upon him by the Guru, because only then will he be able to understand that unbroken Peace is earned by one’s own Self. In this way the Guru makes the peace as the disciple’s own, because until it is thus found to be his own nature, the disciple cannot experience it permanently. Therefore, the less mature soul is warned that, though his three-fold desires are once subdued by the <em>Sadguru’s</em> Grace, he should not stray away again into the fiery desert of sense-pleasures. This effort of his is described here as the worthy <em>Guru-puja</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-619">Refer also to <em>Who am I?</em>, where the same idea is expressed in the following words: “… those who are captured by the glance of the Guru’s Grace will surely be saved and not abandoned. YET, ONE SHOULD FOLLOW WITHOUT FAIL THE PATH SHOWN BY THE GURU!”</p>
<p id = "para-620"><b>319. One’s merging into the Heart – through the enquiryinto the nature of the ego, which is a delusion in the form of mind – is the right worship of the Lotus-Feet of the supreme <em>Mouna-Guru</em>, who is beyond the mind.</b></p>
<p id = "para-621"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Since the Guru is nothing but the supreme <em>Mouna</em> (Silence) which is beyond the mind, any worship performed by the mind will not be fitting. By merging the mind into the Heart, Silence alone prevails, and that is the right medium through which He can be fittingly worshipped.</p>
<p id = "para-622"><b>320. The right worship of the Lotus-Feet of the Guru, whoshines as the vast Supreme Space, is the prevention of the rising and spreading of the dark cloud of the wrong outlook of the ego, who, though behaving as the body, pretends to be <em>Sat-Chit</em> [Existence-Consciousness – i.e. Self].</b></p>
<p id = "para-623"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The wrong outlook of the ego, which is described here as a dark cloud, is to see a multiplicity of names and forms, which are all unreal. This dark cloud thus obscures the nameless and formless Reality, which is the true nature of the Guru, and hence the right <em>Guru-puja</em> is the prevention of the ego’s rising.</p>

<p id = "para-626"><b>322. It is certainly impossible for one to attain and enjoythe Supreme Bliss of Liberation, the ultimate Gain, unless one receives the Grace of the <em>Sadguru</em>, who shines as the one Whole, which puts an end to the differences of [dyads and] triads.</b></p>
<p id = "para-627"><b>323.

<p id = "para-631"><b>326. The grand, natural and sweet Self-abidance [<em>SahajaAtma-Nishta</em>] of the <em>Sadguru</em>, who is devoid of the ego-sense, is the mighty Sword which can cut deep and remove the heart-knot [<em>hridaya-granthi</em>] of His loving disciples.</b></p>
<p id = "para-632"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: This verse describes the power of the <em>Sadguru’s</em> Self-abidance.

<p id = "para-685">There is an old Tamil saying which says that if one loses one’s hold on a branch, one will be ruined, and hence it is rather strange and beautiful that Sri Bhagavan uses the same simile to assure us that loss of individuality is the highest attainment, and that it should not be feared. The significance of this simile can best be understood from the following story: A man was once seen standing under a tree, but clinging to a branch above his head, as if for dear life. When his friends asked him why he was clinging with so much fear to the branch, he replied that if he let go he would fall to the ground. Wondering at his foolishness, his friends pointed out to him that he was already standing on the ground, and that he therefore had nothing to fear; after much trouble they persuaded him to let go of the branch, whereupon he discovered the truth of their assurance. Those who fear to lose their individuality are just like this man; but clinging to their individuality they are gaining nothing, and if they once let go of it they will know for themselves that they are always the Ever-Blissful Self, and that there was never anything for them to fear.</p>

<p id = "para-789"><b>411. Alas, because of the delusion caused by not knowingthat <em>tapas</em>, which is one’s natural duty, should be done with love, people torture themselves in the fire of miserable <em>tapas</em>, in spite of the fact that the Ocean of Bliss [the true Goal of <em>tapas</em>] is always brimming over.</b></p>
<p id = "para-790"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Tapas</em> literally means scorching, or undergoing, self-inflicted tortures, but since these meanings seem to be inappropriate, Sri Bhagavan has given us a new definition for this word in <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em> verse 30. In that verse we told that <em>Atma-Nishta</em> [i.e. Self-abidance – which is the Ocean of Bliss] is the real <em>Tapas</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-791">There are some people who, in the name of <em>tapas</em>, torture their bodies by engaging in austerities such as <em>panchatapagni</em> [i.e. sitting for meditation surrounded by five fires – above and on four sides], etc. These activities can be called <em>tapas</em> in its literal sense, yet they are only performed for the fulfilment of desires, either in this world or in the next. Though these desires may be selfish [i.e. for one’s own individual benefit] or unselfish [i.e. for the benefit of the whole world], they are possible only so long as the ego survives. The aim of true <em>tapas</em>, on the other hand, is Bliss, which can only be achieved when the ego is annihilated.</p>
<p id = "para-792">Therefore, highly discriminative people should perform the true <em>tapas</em> of destroying the ego. The only path or <em>tapas</em> which will destroy the ego is Self-attention [which is often known as Selfenquiry]. Is this Self-attention a self-inflicted torture or a scorching experience? According to the divine saying ‘I am the Path and the Goal’, the path must be as blissful as the Goal, and since everyone knows from his own experience in sleep that the state of egolessness is blissful, it is clear that attending to Self, which is the nearest and the dearest to all of us, will also be blissful, and it will not be an experience of torture or misery. Thus, since Self-attention is to be undertaken with such love and pleasure, why should it be regarded as being <em>tapas</em> in its literal sense? Therefore Sri Bhagavan declares that to think of <em>tapas</em> as being a miserable experience is due to delusion and ignorance, and thus He introduces a revolutionary idea about <em>tapas</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-793">Happiness is our true Nature, but through inattention born of ignorance, we leave it, come out and suffer. Hence our natural and happy duty is to lovingly restore Self-attention and to thus abide in our true Nature.</p>

<p id = "para-796"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The Path by which <em>Jnanis</em> reach Self is Selfenquiry, which is the real <em>Jnana-marga</em>, but since the ego itself vanishes on this path, not only is no trace left behind, but also no one is left to find it.</p>
<p id = "para-797">When it is said that “it is impossible to trace the path”, it means that the path can neither be known or expressed because, although we are given clues to such as Self-attention, when the ego attempts through practice to know what Self-attention exactly is, the ego itself is lost.

<p id = "para-828"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: ‘Turn your attention taking that Consciousness alone as one’s target’: This is the state in which one consciously remains, not knowing other things and not forgetting oneself. Since throughout the waking and dream states the mind was in the habit of attending to other things, the second persons [i.e. the world, which is a mental conception], it can only conceive even God, who is in truth beyond mental conception, to be an object of perception. But now, when the mind attends to Self, Self destroys this illusory habit of the mind and makes it know: ‘I do not exist, only Self, the real God, truly exists’. Thus Consciousness, one’s target, itself as the Guru reveals the truth.</p>
<p id = "para-829">The mind’s longing to see God in the form of an object [i.e. as a second person] is due to the forgetfulness of its true nature – Existence-Consciousness – and to its acting with doership as an individual.

<p id = "para-835"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: The word ‘Heart’ denotes Self and not a place. Being Self <em>[Atma Nishta]</em> is itself knowing Self <em>[Atma Jnana]</em>. Consciousness <em>[Chit]</em> knows existence <em>[Sat]</em> because existence is not other than consciousness.</p>
<p id = "para-836"><b>436. All that is known should be known to be merely thatknowledge [which knows them] and should merge into Knowledge – Self. One’s very reality which shines in such an intensity of Self-abidance, utterly destroying all differences, is Liberation – the unequalled state.</b></p>

<p id = "para-839"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the real Thing <em>[Sat]</em> is one and not many, the real Knowledge <em>[Chit]</em> must also be one: the knowledge of one’s own existence, and it cannot be the knowing of many things.

<p id = "para-853"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: In the understanding of most aspirants, ‘Self-realization’ is the attainment of something – Self, which they believe they do not have as yet, while in fact ‘Self-realization’ is the loss of something – the ego, which is already there. “… To make room, it is enough that the lumber be removed; room is not brought in from elsewhere” says Sri Bhagavan in <em>Maharshi’s Gospel</em> Part I, chapter 4 (see also <em>Maha Yoga</em>, 7th edition, page 121).</p>

Thus should you know!</b></p>
<p id = "para-855"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: ‘The dream which is false’ is this present waking state. ‘the true awakening’ is the state of <em>Turiya</em> or <em>Jnana</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-856"><b>445. When ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are destroyed by the clear trueKnowledge, which is free from the questionable knowledge [‘I am the body’], even while living in this illusory world, that is the state in which one abides as That.</b></p>
<p id = "para-857"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: ‘free from the questionable knowledge’ may also be translated as ‘free from the five sense-knowledges …’</p>
<p id = "para-858">The purpose of the two previous verses is to describe the true nature of the attainment of Self; since the <em>Mahavakya</em> ‘<em>I am That</em>’ denotes this state of Self-attainment (Self-realization) the destruction of the ego is also the attainment of ‘<em>I am That</em>’, as is described in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-859"><b>446. Since the reality, the source [of ‘I’, the ego], shines sovery subtle in the heart as to be known only to a very subtle attention, it is impossible for those whose mind is as gross and as blunt as the head of a pestle to attain the target!</b></p>

<p id = "para-861"><b>74 ‘The Conclusive Knowledge to be Obtained’ or ‘The Well-established Knowledge’</b></p>
<p id = "para-862"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The title of this chapter has two meanings:</p>
<p id = "para-863">1) ‘The conclusive knowledge to be obtained (through reflection)’, and</p>
<p id = "para-864">2) ‘The well-established knowledge (the <em>Jnana</em> of the <em>Jnani</em>)’.</p>
<p id = "para-865">Out of the four verses in this chapter, the first three deal with the conclusion which we have to reach through reading and reflection, and the fourth verse describes the state of unshakeable Selfknowledge of a <em>Jnani</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-866"><b>447. Because in the perfect Thing – Silence [Self], nothought rises, because place is merely a thought, and because the two other places [second and third persons] rise only after the rising of ‘I’, ‘I’ [the first person] is the first place.</b></p>
<p id = "para-867"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In Tamil grammar, (1) ‘I’, the first person, (2) ‘you’, the second person, and (3) ‘he, she, it, or they’, the third person, are called the first place, second place and third place respectively, unlike in most other languages. Those who do deep reflection [<em>manana</em>] i.e. deep thinkers, can find out that this is a good clue for the spiritual quest. How? Time and place [space] are the first two conceptions [illusions] born of <em>maya</em>. In this verse instructions about the nature of ‘place’ are given, whereas in verses 747 and 748 of this work and in verses 15 and 16 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> the nature of ‘time’ is well described.</p>
<p id = "para-868">Because Self is mere Being, which has no rising, it is to be known that even the first person, which has a rising, is not there. Refer also to the 14th verse of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> which says: “…When the first person ceases to exist through enquiry into the truth of that first person…”</p>
<p id = "para-869">Ego is thought identifying as ‘I’ a body which is bound by time and space. Therefore, time and place cannot but be found interwoven in every thought that rises from the ego. Though, at first, it may seem to be a wonder to hear that no one can make any thought without time and place, after a little reflection it will be found that it is an undeniable truth. Let us now see this verse once again in the light of this explanation.</p>
<p id = "para-870">Since out of the three places, first, second and third, ‘I’ is the one that rises first, Sri Bhagavan points out that ‘I’ is the foremost among the place conceptions. Further, it is pointed out that, since place is a mere thought, even ‘I’, the first place is merely a thought. Moreover, by pointing out the logical inference: ‘No thought can rise in Self, since the form of Self, the perfect thing, is Silence’, Sri Bhagavan concludes that even the least rising of ‘I’, the ego, is not possible there.</p>
<p id = "para-871">Just as ‘I’, which among the three places [first, second and third places] is taken for spiritual research stands as the first and the source of all places, so also the ‘present’, which among the three tenses [past, present and future] is taken for spiritual research, stands as the first and source of all divisions of time. Just as ‘I’, the first place disappears when enquired into, the ‘present’, the first time, also disappears on enquiry, revealing the timeless and placeless [spaceless] nature of the supreme, Self. Since even the first time, i.e. the ‘present’, is merely a thought, just like the first person it cannot have a rising in Self. Thus, since Self transcends time and space, <em>Ajata</em> (see the note to verse 100) must be known to be the right conclusive knowledge to be obtained, and this is to be understood to be the aim of this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-872">Finally, from the three reasons given in this verse, we have to draw six conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p id = "para-873">Self is not a place</p>
</li>
<li><p id = "para-874">place does not exist in Self</p>
</li>

<li><p id = "para-876">‘I’ is the first place</p>
</li>
<li><p id = "para-877">Self has no rising 6) Self is not the first place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id = "para-878"><b>448. That which rises as ‘I’ in the body is mind. When anattempt is made to find out wherefrom this thought ‘I’ rises in the body, it [the ‘I’-thought, or mind, which thus searches] reaches the Heart, therefore, it is indeed from Heart [Self] that the mind rises.</b></p>
<p id = "para-879"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: These are the words of Sri Bhagavan in <em>Who am I?</em> When we wake up the ‘I’-feeling rises from one place in the body and then spreads all over the body; what is described in this verse as ‘first’ is that place. However, Sri Bhagavan here gives us a clue that by so tracing the ‘I’-thought, a place will not be found, but the tracing power, the one who traces, will dissolve into Self.</p>
<p id = "para-880"><b>449. Other than thoughts there is no God, world or soul. Inall thoughts, the thought ‘I’ is pervading. This ‘I’-thought is the first of all thoughts. The source from which the ‘I’-thought rises is the Heart.</b></p>
<p id = "para-881"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: When in this verse and the previous verse Heart is said to be the source from which the mind rises, Heart should not be taken to be a place. It must be understood to be the thing from which mind emerges. The reason for asserting so is given in the next verse.</p>
<p id = "para-882"><b>450. Those who abide firmly in Self will never know anyother thing as a base [i.e. as a place] but Self.

<p id = "para-883"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The <em>ajnani</em> feels that he is only the body, and therefore he experiences the universe as outside of himself. That is, he thinks that all things are existing or somewhere in space; in his view, earth or space are the base for all. The <em>Jnani</em>, on the other hand, does not limit Himself as a body and therefore knows that He is not in the universe but that it is in Him. That is to say, He experiences that His existence is the base on which, or place in which, all other things, including earth and space, exist. He knows that because He is, everything seems to exist, and hence they are in Him and He alone is their base.</p>

But if, by means of enquiry, one realises one’s real state as the pure self-existent consciousness, devoid of the attachment to the body, the ego-consciousness which was experienced in waking and dream as one’s self-existence will be found to be unreal, and the knowledge that the state which was referred to till then as sleep is the perfect, real Selfconciousness will dawn. It is only to make this clear that Sri Bhagavan said in <em>Maharshi’s Gospel</em>: “Sleep is not ignorance, it is one’s pure state; wakefulness is not knowledge, it is ignorance.

<p id = "para-899"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: For Self, which was shining during sleep, there was no delusion of such knowledge and ignorance. All these are only for the ego.

It is only one’s attachment, the desire to be active in <em>vijnanamaya</em>, that drags one out of the <em>anandamaya kosha</em> [sleep].

<p id = "para-915"><b>467.

<p id = "para-916"><b>468. In ancient days the chaste lady [Draupadi] had herhonour saved and her sari lengthened by the Grace of Lord Krishna only when at last, letting go of her own hold on her sari, she lifted up both her hands in complete surrender to Him; and the strong wicked one [Duchasana] who was stripping her fell down abashed.</b></p>
<p id = "para-917"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: So long as Draupadi was trying to hold her sari by her own hands lest it should be stripped off and was calling Sri Krishna for help, His Grace did not begin to function. But as soon as, having complete faith in His gracious protection, she gave up holding her clothes with her own hands and lifted them above her head, her surrender became complete and hence His Grace began to function by making her sari grow unendingly and by making the wicked Duchasana, who was stripping her, fall down in a swoon. This incident is pointed out there in order to instruct us that we should give up the sense of doership and should thus surrender to God completely and unreservedly.</p>
<p id = "para-918"><b>469. Those who, like a child who does not seek to knowwhat is good for it [but leans upon its parents], purely depend upon the Mother, <em>Chit-Sakti</em>, the Grace of the Lord, reach His feet and remain naturally in His service [i.e. abide in Self], having lost all actionsdone-with-doership, which are caused by the defectful delusion [<em>maya</em>] ‘I am the body’.</b></p>
<p id = "para-919"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Rather than upon their own effort [which is only the sense of doership], devotees or aspirants always depend upon the power of the Grace of the Supreme. This power is personified here as the Mother. She is described as ‘<em>Chit-Sakti</em>’ because Grace shines in everyone in the form of Self-Consciousness – the <em>sphurana</em> ‘I-I’. Since this is purely on account of the unaccountable mercy of the Lord, such Grace of His is described here as the Mother.</p>
<p id = "para-920">The correct way of understanding Sri Bhagavan’s instruction here is that aspirants should completely and without doubting cling to the Self-consciousness ‘I-I’. Like a child which, not even trying to know what is good for itself, depends solely upon its mother, if an aspirant, not even trying to know any scriptures, trying to do any yoga, or expecting any help from outside, simply clings to the ‘I’-consciousness, that alone is sufficient and he will easily and surely be saved form all delusion and pitfalls.</p>
<p id = "para-921">Since clinging to the ‘I’-consciousness is merely a ‘being’ and not a ‘doing’, neither does it need doership nor does it turn out to be action [<em>karma</em>] even. Thus the aspirant naturally ever abides in Self. Sri Bhagavan advises that this Self-abidance alone is the state of one’s remaining in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p id = "para-922"><b>470. The Lord who has fed you today will ever do so well.Therefore, live carefree, placing all your burden at His feet and having no thought of tomorrow or the future.</b></p>
<p id = "para-923"><b>471. Know well that even performing <em>tapas</em> and <em>yoga</em> with the intention ‘I should become an instrument in the hands of the Lord Siva’ is a blemish to complete self-surrender, which is the highest form of being in His service.</b></p>
<p id = "para-924"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since even the thought ‘I am an instrument in the Lord’s hand’ is a means by which the ego retains its individuality, it is directly opposed to the spirit of complete self-surrender, the ‘I’-lessness. Are there not many good-natured people who engage themselves in prayers, worship, yoga and such virtuous acts with the aim of achieving power form God and doing good to the world as one divinely commissioned? It is exposed here that even such endeavours are egotistical and hence contrary to self-surrender. <b>472. One’s thus becoming a slave to the Lord and one’s remaining quiet and silent, devoid even of the egotistical thought ‘I am His slave’, is Self-abidance, and this is the supreme Knowledge.</b></p>
<p id = "para-925"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: How the same supreme knowledge which is obtained through the path of <em>Jnana</em> [Self-enquiry] is obtained even through the path of <em>Bhakti</em> [self-surrender] is shown in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-926"><b>473. Seated in the Heart of everyone as Heart, the Lord willordain everything according to one’s destiny [<em>prarabdha</em>]. Therefore, if we unswervingly abide in Self, our source, all will happen unerringly.</b></p>

<p id = "para-928"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Devotees with great faith in God never feel concern for the needs of their life, because they are so sure that God will never abandon them. Even when it happens that they are not provided with their needs, they do not feel that they are afflicted; they simply endure with it patiently, feeling that it is only God who has to suffer by seeing them troubled. Hence on all occasions they are happy. This verse thus assures that for such devotees there is no misery at all in life.</p>
<p id = "para-929"><b>475. Since God alone is the root, all that is offered to Himwill go to the whole banyan tree, the world and souls which sprout out from Him, the root.</b></p>
<p id = "para-930"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Submitting oneself to God is like watering a banyan tree at its root. If, rejecting this self-surrender, which is nothing but the state of true knowledge, one engages oneself in the world thinking that one is doing service to the world, it is just like spraying water on the leaves and branches of the banyan tree. On the other hand, if one surrenders oneself to God, truly that alone is the real service to the whole world and all the souls.</p>
<p id = "para-931">Here, some may doubt that this instruction seems to contradict the 5th verse of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>. But in truth it is not so. How? Verse 5 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em> points out that worshipping the universe by imagining it to be God is only a thought-process [<em>enni vazhipadal</em>], and that its fruit is also only the purification of one’s own mind [<em>karuttai tirutti</em> – as pointed out in verse 3]; such worship is not for the benefit of the universe. But by surrendering oneself to God, thought or imaginations stop and one attains the state of perfect knowledge. Attaining this supreme knowledge alone is truly helping or serving the world. Hence, the instruction given in verse 5 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em> is for those <em>sadhakas</em> who want to gain purification of mind [<em>Chitta-suddhi</em>], whereas the instruction given in this present verse is for those <em>sadhakas</em> who want truly to serve the whole world. Therefore, if we scrutinize in this way, it becomes clear that these two instructions do not contradict each other.</p>
<p id = "para-932">How is the true knowledge alone the best service to the world? Let us see. Suppose one dreams in his sleep that his friends are wounded by a tiger. Rather than his supplying medicine to his dream-friends, would not his waking up from his sleep be doing real help to them? No other efforts taken in the dream itself will be a real service to them. So also, realising Self, which is the real awakening alone will be the only proper way of serving the whole universe.</p>
<p id = "para-933">Since jumping into service of the world with a sense of doership will increase the egoism of an aspirant instead of giving him <em>chitta-suddhi</em>, the real benefit of <em>karma yogi</em>, Sri Bhagavan, with the intention of saving aspirants from such ruin, gives them proper instruction in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-934"><b>79 The Attainment of Actionlessness</b></p>
<p id = "para-935"><b>476. Whether or not one is performing actions, if the delusion of individuality – the ego, ‘I am the doer of actions’ – is completely annihilated, that is the attainment of actionlessness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-936"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: People generally think that the attainment of actionlessness is a state in which one should remain still, giving up all activities. But this is wrong. Sri Bhagavan Ramana proclaims that the loss of doership alone is the right kind of actionlessness, and this alone is <em>nishkamya karma</em> – action done without any desire for result.</p>
<p id = "para-937"><b>80 Self-Surrender</b></p>
<p id = "para-938"><b>477. To him who surrenders himself [‘I’ and ‘mine’] to theLord, the Lord gives Himself here and now. Only such a one who has thus lost himself [in God] and gained the knowledge of <em>Brahman</em>, remains ever in the experience of the pure supreme Bliss of Siva.</b></p>
<p id = "para-939"><b><em>Sri Muruganar and Michael James</em></b>: Surrendering oneself to God means surrendering the notions ‘I’ and ‘mine’. The Lord’s giving Himself means that, after the loss of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, alone remains. To denote the nature of his shining forth as Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, Sri Bhagavan says that ‘such a one gains the Knowledge [<em>Chit</em>] and drowns in Bliss [<em>ananda</em>]’. Since Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, which is one’s own nature, takes no time to shine forth as soon as ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are lost, it is said in this verse that the Lord gives Himself ‘here and now’.</p>
<p id = "para-940"><b>478. When scrutinized well, what results from all theefforts made in <em>Bhakti-marga</em> is that one’s ego-form dissolves through the strength of intense meditation on the Feet of the Lord, and the individuality is lost at His Feet by self-surrender.</b></p>
<p id = "para-941"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: How does the ego-form dissolve through the strength of intense meditation on the Feet of the Lord? Intense meditation on His Feet is possible only when there is intense love towards Him. Because of such intense love for Him, the aspirant does not care for his own body and its needs. Thus he loses interest in his own individuality and hence his ego-form is dissolved. It is to be noted here, however, that mere concentration without love cannot bring forth egolessness.</p>
<p id = "para-942"><b>479. Erase your individuality, which cannot have a standseparate from the Lord, who shines as everything. The right definition of supreme devotion, where the blissful peace prevails, is the surrender of the evil fickle ego-self.</b></p>

<p id = "para-944"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Those who say “We should surrender ourself to the Lord” do not have an accurate insight into devotion [<em>pra-bhakti</em>]. Self-surrender would become an endeavour [<em>tapas</em>] only if there were a separate freedom for the <em>jiva</em> to do; is it not so? But since the so-called <em>jivatma</em> is ever the possession of the Lord, having no freedom of his own, his foremost duty is that being ashamed of his act of stealing by rising as an independent entity, ‘I’, he should merge back into Him once for all and become non-existent.</p>
<p id = "para-945"><b>481. There will be no cause for fear for one whose mindabides by the will of the Lord praying, “O Lord, let nothing happen according to my wish; let only Thy will be done”.</b></p>

Refer also to verse 1189.</p>
<p id = "para-948"><b>483. Giving up all one’s wishes through the attitude “Thywish alone is mine” is the state of complete surrender, in which the evil ego, the original veiling, the firstrising one, is annihilated. Thus should you know.</b></p>

Therefore, remaining quiet, abiding in Self, giving no room to the rising of ‘I’, which is the sin of usurping God’s possession, is the best of all worships.</p>

<p id = "para-959"><b>488. Good people [aspirants] should not with dejectionhate enemies even a little, however bad they may be. For even hatred, like desire, is fit to be hated.</b></p>
<p id = "para-960"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse gives the same <em>upadesa</em> given by Sri Bhagavan in <em>Who am I?</em>: “One should not dislike others, no matter how bad they are. It is both likes and dislikes that are to be disliked.”</p>
<p id = "para-961"><b>489. Since that [this body, and the ego, the form of whichis ‘I am the body’] which is rejected by an aspirant as ‘not I’ is the same as that which is ridiculed by his enemies, for an aspirant who wants to destroy the ego [himself], the various insults from his enemies are just like an anvil to the goldsmith.</b></p>
<p id = "para-962"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: An aspirant means one who truly wants to destroy his ego-sense. He and his ego-sense are one and the same. Through the paths of both self-surrender and Self-enquiry, what he rejects or hates is the ego or himself. Since those [his enemies] who hate or scold him are also doing the same, they are pointed out here to be great helpers in his project. This is explained by the example of a goldsmith and his anvil. Because the anvil is resisting from below each of his hammer-blows, the goldsmith is able to shape his metal properly. If the anvil is soft, all the efforts of the goldsmith will be in vain. Similarly, the more appreciation an aspirant receives, the less will be the subsidence of his ego. Thus, rather than his appreciators, his enemies are helping the aspirant in his <em>sadhana</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-963"><b>490. Only that mighty one who has the great valour to conquer hatred by love is a true Sage [<em>muni</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-964"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: “Hatred cannot end hatred” was the teaching of Buddha. However, even some spiritual aspirants, on seeing atrocities and thinking that it is their duty to attack the wrong-doers, jump into the matter with anger.

This verse explains how Self, being the Guru within, teaches the true knowledge to a fully mature soul even without taking a human form outside. The shining of ‘I-I’, the essence of the consciousness ‘am’, is the silent teaching of the inner Guru, Self. Since the supreme, non-dual knowledge is nothing but the Self-consciousness ‘I am’, its shining as ‘I-I’ itself is the silent inner advice of the Guru inducing the disciple [the mind] to abide ever in It. This is how Self acts as Guru from within.</p>

<p id = "para-1004"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: We should remember here Sri Bhagavan’s instruction in verse 32 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> as to what an earnest and sincere disciple should do when he hears the <em>Mahavakya</em> ‘That Thou Art’ from a Guru. As soon as he hears the phrase ‘That Thou Art’, the disciple’s attention should turn to know ‘What am I?’ This is the real aim with which the <em>Mahavakya</em> was revealed. The one important word that stands in the above <em>Mahavakya</em> to turn the disciple’s mind to Self-attention is ‘Thou’. Therefore this verse categorically asserts that out of the three words, ‘Thou’ alone should be taken for scrutiny by a worthy disciple. The following two verses also emphasize the same idea.</p>
<p id = "para-1005"><b>507. Only in order to turn inward the minds of less matureaspirants, which will be favourable for the aforesaid enquiry, [the <em>Vedas</em>] added the other two words ‘That’ [<em>tat</em>] and ‘Art’ [<em>asi</em>] to the word ‘Thou’ [<em>tvam</em>], thereby forming the <em>Mahavakya</em> ‘That Thou Art’ [<em>tat tvam asi</em>].

<p id = "para-1011"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The teaching imparted through this verse is that the foremost and immediate duty of the modern mind, which is full of scientific knowledge, is, instead of feeling proud of its petty knowledge, to give up its pride and follow the path of Self-knowledge shown by the <em>Upanishads</em>. Since it is a well-known fact that the knowledge of worldly science, though it has developed more and more, has never yet found an end, this verse instructs that, if it wants to achieve a complete knowledge, the human intellect which engages in science, which will never provide anything but an incomplete knowledge, has to take refuge under the mercy of the <em>Upanishads</em>, which alone teach Self-knowledge, the final and complete knowledge.

<p id = "para-1017"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Here, <em>upasana</em> should be understood to mean clinging to Self, that is, attending to Self, which is Self-enquiry. For, Self-enquiry alone bestows all the divine qualities [<em>deyva sambat</em>]. The word ‘<em>sambat</em>’ means ‘that which is earned’. Since all things earned externally will bring only misery to the <em>jiva</em>, ‘<em>deyva sambat</em>’ alone is worthy to be earned, and is developed solely by Selfenquiry.</p>

<p id = "para-1022"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The nature of the wave is to move. The nature of the ocean is to remain motionless. If the wandering wave loves the ocean, that is, if it loves the nature of the ocean, namely, to remain still, it will lose its wave-form, subside, drown into the ocean and thereby become the ocean itself, that is, it will become motionless. Likewise, if the <em>jiva</em>, the wandering mind, loves Siva, the Self, he will lose his <em>jiva</em>-nature, that is, the nature of moving and standing as a separate entity, dissolve in Siva and become Siva Himself.</p>

<p id = "para-1026"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: It is indicated in this verse that making the mind still, that is, keeping it unaffected by <em>sakala</em> (the state of manyness) and <em>kevala</em> (the state of nothingness), is what is called <em>nishtha</em> or <em>samadhi</em>.</p>

The ten verses sung by Sri Jnanasambandhar in order to conquer the effects of planets and also some other songs of Tamil saints assure us that none of these time factors can create any obstacle for a devotee who comes under the power of the Grace of God.</p>

<p id = "para-1141"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Just as one big open space becomes three parts when two partition walls are newly erected in the midst of it, so when the two kinds of body-identification, namely the identification with the waking-body and the identification with the dream-body, imaginarily rise, our one unbroken Self-consciousness itself appears to become three states, namely waking, dream and sleep. We who experience and name our original state when the body in waking is identified as ‘I’, and as the dream state when the body in dream is identified as ‘I’, also experience and name our original, adjunctless state of pure Self-consciousness, which then remains as if our third state, as sleep.</p>
<p id = "para-1142">When the two walls of waking and dream in the form of the two body-identifications are destroyed through Self-enquiry, our unlimited, natural and single Self-consciousness is experienced as the one adjunctless clear state, like the one big open space. Since this is experienced as a new state, completely different from those three states [waking, dream and sleep] experienced till then, it is named by scriptures as ‘the fourth’ [<em>turiya</em>]. But when the knowledge ‘This is nothing but our eternal, natural state’ dawns through the well-established experience of the natural state of Self [<em>sahaja atma sthita</em>] and when waking, dream and sleep are thereby known to be unreal, the name ‘<em>turiya</em>’, the fourth, will also become meaningless, since this state will have thus lost its newness. Hence, since this natural, non-dual, eternal Self-consciousness thus cannot be called ‘<em>turiya</em>’ [the fourth state]. The scriptures again named it as ‘<em>turiyatita</em>’ [the state of transcending <em>turiya</em>, the fifth state]! But all these classifications and differences of states are merely verbal, and in reality they do not exist at all. These five kinds of states are classified and told to aspirants during their period of ignorance and for their mental satisfaction.

If we, the existence [<em>sat</em>], the fullness of contentment [<em>ananda</em>], desire to obtain sense-objects for our contentment, our nature of fullness of contentment is made by that desire into a nature of deficiency; thus it [the desire] swallows us [kills us] by creating an insatiable fire of desire.</p>

<p id = "para-1217">One evening at 4 pm during Sri Bhagavan’s stay at Virupaksha Cave, an old <em>brahmin</em> came there with his daughter and offered a big plateful of costly sweets. Sri Bhagavan accepted a little of it, and the rest was distributed to all the devotees present, who were immensely happy since in those days they were not getting even enough ordinary food to satisfy their needs. The devotees were very happy, but Sri Bhagavan did not seem to be so pleased. On the third day when she came with her usual plate, though all the devotees were very happy, Sri Bhagavan told her with a look of displeasure, “What is this? Why do you bring today also? I did not mind when you brought it once or twice, but why do you daily bring such costly things? If there is any expectation behind these offerings, it is wrong.

According to scriptures, <em>kutastha</em> is more real than <em>vyavaharika</em>, and <em>vyavaharika</em> is more real than <em>swapnakalpita</em>, since <em>swapnakalpita</em> is an imaginary being, that is, he is the one who, through imagination, comes into existence in dream. But in this verse Sri Bhagavan declares that not only <em>swapnakalpita</em>, but even <em>vyavaharika</em>, is imaginary, that <em>vyavaharika</em> therefore has no greater reality than <em>swapnakalpita</em>, and that <em>vyavaharika</em> is merely another kind of <em>swapnakalpita</em>, because <em>vyavharika’s</em> reality is the same as the reality of the world in which he lives and acts. Since this world in the waking state is also nothing but an imaginary, dream-like thing, Sri Bhagavan declares that even <em>vyavaharika</em> is a <em>swapnakalpita</em>.</p>

<p id = "para-1259"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Is not the <em>jiva</em> [the ego], who has a name and form as ‘I am so-and-so’, the one who gains fame or receives praise? Therefore, it is possible to aspire for fame or praise only when we take upon ourselves the state of an ego, a wretched and downtrodden state caused by <em>pramada</em>. Hence, it is advised that those wise people who aspire for Self-knowledge should necessarily reject the possibility of gaining name and fame. It is highly improper for such aspirants [<em>mumukshus</em>] to run madly after name and fame. Verse 263 of <em>Tirukkural</em> states: “Be born to live with fame; for those who do not achieve fame, it is better not be born”. Tiruvalluvar [the author of <em>Tirukkural</em>] has rightly said that fame is essential only for those who want to be born as a <em>jiva</em> [as an ego]. But since <em>mumukshus</em> are those who do not like to be born, but who like only to put an end to their <em>jiva</em>-hood and to realize Self, the fame which was recommended by Tiruvalluvar is an obstacle and a great evil for them. That is why Sri Bhagavan says that it should be rejected with contempt by wise people.</p>
<p id = "para-1260"><b>624. By exposing oneself due to the desire of being praisedby others, one is unnecessarily removing one’s protection and creating obstacles to the <em>sadhana</em> one has undertaken.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1261"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The desire for the annihilation of the ego is the right sign of <em>atma-sadhana</em>. But fame and praise are things to be gained only by the ego. Therefore, if one has a desire for fame it means that one does not like to destroy the ego. That is why Sri Bhagavan says that the one who has desire for fame is himself creating obstacles to his <em>sadhana</em>. Therefore, if the <em>atma-sadhana</em> is to progress unobstructed and well protected, it is better for an aspirant to live a life of unknown name and unknown place.</p>

We may wonder how an insentient thing called ‘world’ can laugh. That is the beauty of this verse. We should understand this verse having in mind the idea taught in verse 74 of this work. Will not an unchaste and base-natured prostitute laugh within herself when she hears the appreciating words of her infatuated new lover, who says to his friend, “Oh, this woman, my lover, is the most chaste woman in the world”. Likewise, the world laughs within itself at those who think that it is real. Thus this verse personifies the world nicely. Sri Bhagavan gives more emphasis to the fact that the world is unreal by exposing in this verse that the support or evidence of no other is needed to prove the unreality of the world, for the world itself knows that it is unreal. This is the climax of the fun in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-1288">This verse contains the same instruction given by Sri Bhagavan in <em>Maharshi’s Gospel</em>, Book Two, chapter three [8th edition, page 63], “Well then, that world, which you say is real, is really mocking at you for seeking to prove its reality while of your own reality you are ignorant”.</p>

<p id = "para-1290"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The world cannot appear where the mind-light is absent. That is to say, in the true light of Self the universe, which consists of objects that are created (by thinking), sustained (by continuing to think) and destroyed (by forgetting), does not at all exist. On the other hand, since Self (or God), the truly existing Thing, is beyond the range of mind-light, to the mind It is non-existent. The reason why Self is said to be beyond the range of mind-light, whose function is thinking and forgetting, is that It is a Thing which can neither be thought of nor forgotten, and which can Itself neither think nor forget.</p>
<p id = "para-1291"><b>637. When a thing is known in front [of you], it only establishes that something exists, but does not establish that the form which is made to appear by the contact of the senses with it, is the reality or true nature of that thing.</b></p>

<p id = "para-1295"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If we now view verse 636 through the eye of the idea given in this verse, we will understand clearly that the reason why it was said there that only those things which come within the range of the mind are known to have existence, is that ‘seeing’ is possible only when the seer and the seen are on the same plane of reality [<em>sat</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-1296">In this verse we are taught a unique idea! Do not many of us say, “It is easy to see other things since they are different from us, the seer, but it is difficult for us to see Self since It is not different from us?” However, if we scrutinize the matter in accordance with this verse, we will find that the law of nature about the seer, seen and seeing is quite contrary to this. It is indirectly but firmly instructed here that to know Self is the easiest, because the reality [<em>sat</em>] of the seer [the ego] is in truth Self, the one reality, which we want to see or know.</p>
<p id = "para-1297">We should also consider here the fact that the seeing of a dream is possible only because all the objects seen in that dream have the same reality [<em>sat</em>] as that of the dreamer who sees the dream.</p>
<p id = "para-1298">One more point is also to be understood here. Since the reality or nature of the knower, the ego is the same as the reality or nature of all the objects known [not only of all the objects known through the eyes, that is, the objects seen, but also of all the objects known through the other four senses, that is, the objects heard, smelt, tasted and touched], a thing as world is known to be existing, which is nothing other than the knowledge obtained through the five senses. And since, because it rises and sets, the nature of the ego is false, the world of names and forms, which also has the nature of rising and setting, is also said to be false. But when the real nature of the ego, which lives only by feeding upon the names and forms, which rise and set, is scrutinized [enquired into] and found to be Self or <em>Brahman</em>, the true reality [<em>sat</em>], which does not have the false nature of rising and setting, then the reality of the world will also be found to be Self. Refer here to verse 4 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, where Sri Bhagavan asks, “Can the seen be otherwise than the eye (the seer)?”. Only then will the absolute truth, namely that even the world is real – that it is <em>Brahman</em> itself – be properly understood [refer here to verses 50 and 52 of this work]. Till then, it is indispensable [and since it will help one to reach the absolute reality, it is also highly recommendable] for the aspirants to take the reality [<em>sat</em>] of the seer, the ego, to be unreal or <em>asat</em>, and also to conclude that, since the world has the same reality [<em>sat</em>] as the seer, it is unreal.</p>

<p id = "para-1302"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: In this verse, it is said in a ridiculing manner that it is futile to toil and wander in order to obtain bliss, which will be ever available if we simply keep still, doing nothing!</p>
<p id = "para-1303">This verse may also be interpreted to have a second meaning as follows: “For the bliss which will shine even when one remains still, wandering in [the <em>sadhana</em> of] proudly knowing oneself as the great Self, which has no coming, is to attain that bliss”. However, since this second meaning is not a coherent sentence and since the reasoning in it is not consistent, it is not a fitting meaning. Moreover, when the later verses in this chapter are read, it is clear that the aim of this chapter is to expose the futility of objective attention (that is, to expose that Self cannot be attained by attention to second and third person objects), and hence only the first meaning given above will be found to be fitting.</p>
<p id = "para-1304"><b>641.

<p id = "para-1311"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Since the truth of oneself is ever shining in everyone as ‘I am’, it is not a thing to be known anew. Therefore, when the scriptures say “Know the truth of thyself”, their real intention is simply to make us turn our attention towards the ever-known ‘I am’, thereby giving up the attention towards second and third person objects, for such objective attention alone is wrong knowledge or <em>ajnana</em>. Thus, the intention of the scriptures is not to make us know anything new, but only to make us give up our wrong knowledge. In other words, if we merely give up our objective attention, that itself will make it clear to us that we ever know Self.</p>
<p id = "para-1312"><b>646.

<p id = "para-1315">Here readers are warned not to interpret the simile in the following wrong manner: ‘The bride looks at the bridegroom only when he does not look at her. Therefore, Self will reveal itself only when we do not attend to It, that is, only when we attend to the external world’. This is not the meaning which is intended when giving this simile.

When desire is thus removed, all its five offshoots, namely anger, miserliness, delusion, arrogance and jealousy, will also cease to exist [refer to verse 375]. Since all the problems of life are based upon only these six vices, it is said that the knot of all problems in life will be severed by realizing the true nature of love. The truth of love is nothing but Self. How? Since the real nature of Self is <em>asti-bhati-priya</em> or <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, love [<em>priya</em>] or <em>ananda</em> cannot be different form Self.

<p id = "para-1329"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since other kinds of offering may not be available for everyone and at all times, since even those offerings will be worthless if there is no love in the heart, and since if love alone is present it will fill up the deficiency created by the absence of all other offerings, love is here recommended as the supreme offering.</p>

Therefore, keeping love in its pure form, not allowing it to take a <em>vritti</em> form as likes and dislikes, is both (a) not allowing love to be obstructed, and (2) not allowing love to be wrongly forced.

<p id = "para-1357"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Though each frame of a cinema film which is projected onto the screen consists of only one unmoving picture, since many such frames are projected in a second and since the speed of their projection is faster than the grasping power of our eyes, it seems to us as if the film contains one continuously moving picture. Likewise, since everything in this universe, which is under the sway of the five functions of God, is created and destroyed by the inexpressible power of God many crores of times in a second, and since the speed with which they are created and destroyed is faster than the grasping power of our mind [that is, since our mind is unable to grasp the interval between each destruction and the subsequent new creation], it seems to us as if the universe is existing continuously.</p>
<p id = "para-1358">It will be useful here to note what is in fact meant in this verse by the creation and destruction of each atom of the universe. In verse 6 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> Sri Bhagavan asks, “Can there be a world apart from the mind?”, and in <em>Who am I?</em> He says, “Other than thoughts, there is no such thing as the world”. Therefore, since the universe is nothing but thoughts, the rising of thoughts is the creation of the universe and the setting of thoughts is its destruction. All thoughts, which are nothing but second and third persons, rise and set only to the mind, which is nothing but the first thought, ‘I am the body’. Therefore, since all other thoughts can rise only after the mind rises, and since they must set when the mind sets, their rising and setting must necessarily be even more rapid than the rising and setting of the mind, the thought ‘I’, which, through the inexpressible and wonderful power of God, itself rises and sets many crores of times in a second. But since the mind is so fickle that it is unable to grasp or cognize even its own rising and setting, how can it grasp the rising and setting of other thoughts? It is because the mind is thus unable to grasp the speed with which other thoughts rise and set, that it appears to the mind as if there is existing continuously something as the universe. Only when the mind scrutinizes itself, the first person, with a keen and subtle attention, and only when it is thereby able to cognize its own rising and setting, will it cease to rise and instead become motionless [<em>achala</em>]. And only in that state of motionlessness, in which the mind is no longer a mind but Self, will it be able to understand the rising and setting of the world, the second and third person thoughts, and will it have the supreme power not to allow any thought to rise. It is because Bhagavan Ramana is such a One who ever remains firmly established in Self as Self, that He was able to discover and thus reveal the truth about creation, sustenance destruction and so on.</p>

<p id = "para-1363"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: This is a very subtle point. If the <em>jiva’s</em> actions are accepted to be Siva’s actions, then the <em>jiva</em> should not remain different from Siva. In such a state, the <em>jiva</em> will lose all his individual existence and Siva alone will be independent. When the <em>jiva</em> has thus surrendered, there will be no ego [<em>ahankara</em>] in him any more. The state of surrender is the state of the complete destruction of the ego. If one acts with egoism but at the same time says, “All are Siva’s actions,” then it is to be understood that one has not surrendered oneself to Siva.</p>

<p id = "para-1366"><b>669. God’s creation does not bind: only the <em>jiva’s</em> creation, which is a mental conception, binds. This is illustrated by the story of the father of the dead son being happy while the father of the living son lamented.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1367"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The story mentioned in this verse is as follows: Two neighbours called Rama and Krishna, who lived in a small village in South India, went on a pilgrimage to Kasi. On the way Rama died of fever, and Krishna continued alone on his pilgrimage. While proceeding to Kasi, Krishna met another pilgrim who was returning to the south and asked him to convey the news of Rama’s death to his parents. The pilgrim duly came to that village, but while telling the news he said, due to forgetfulness, that Krishna had died and that Rama was proceeding towards Kasi. The parents of Krishna wept and grieved over the loss of their son, who was actually alive, while the parents of Rama were rejoicing over the welfare of their son, who was actually dead. Now, was not the wrong knowledge of the parents the cause for their respective misery and happiness? In the same manner, the cause for the miseries of birth and death experienced by the <em>jivas</em> is only the wrong knowledge, the wrong mental conception, that one is the body. Therefore, the conception ‘I am the body’, which is only a creation of the mind or <em>jiva</em>, is the sole cause of bondage. This is why Sri Bhagavan says in this verse, “Only the <em>jiva’s</em> creation, which is a mental conception, binds”.</p>
<p id = "para-1368">According to their maturity, does not God bestow upon <em>jivas</em> their allotted <em>prarabdha</em> – the selected and arranged fruits of good and bad <em>karmas</em> – for their own uplift? All that we see as our life in a body and as a world in which we live, is nothing but our <em>prarabdha</em>. Do we not think that such a world, which is arranged according to our <em>karmas</em> and <em>vasanas</em>, is the creation of God? Thus the very purpose of the appearance or creation of the world which we see, is to teach us <em>vairagya</em> by making us experience pains and pleasures and thereby to turn our mind towards Self. The state in which the mind is ever turned Selfwards is liberation or <em>moksha</em>. Therefore the very purpose of the world, which is said to be God’s creation, is not to bind us but only to liberate us. That is why it is said in this verse, “God’s creation does not bind”.</p>

<p id = "para-1376"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Refer to the work <em>Who am I?</em>, where Sri Bhagavan says, “After negating as ‘not I, not I’ all that is mentioned above, the knowledge which remains alone, itself is ‘I’ ”.</p>
<p id = "para-1377"><b>673. <em>Editor’s Note</em></b><em>: This verse was missed out on the manuscript I worked with, probably due to a typing oversight sometime in the 1980s when the original was retyped.</em></p>
<p id = "para-1378"><b>674. Whatever thing [among the above-said alien objects,which are not ‘I’] acts in whatever way, remain aloof from those activities [that is, from the notion that it is ‘I’ who acts] and simply be a witness to them.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1379"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The instructions ‘simply be a witness to them’ which Sri Bhagavan gives in this verse should be correctly understood. The word ‘witness’ [<em>sakshi</em>] is used in Vedantic scriptures in a special sense, and it should be understood accordingly. The scriptures explain that Self or <em>Brahman</em> is a witness to all activities just as the sun is a witness to all that happens on earth, that is to say, all activities take place in and because of the mere presence of Self, just as all that happens on earth takes place in and because of the mere presence of the sun. However, just as the sun is unconcerned with [that is, does not attend to] all that happens on earth, so Self is unconcerned with [that is, does not attend to] all the activities that take place in Its presence. Refer here to the work <em>Who am I?</em> in which Sri Bhagavan has clearly explained this simile of the sun, which is unaffected by and unconcerned with all that happens on earth.</p>
<p id = "para-1380">Therefore, when Sri Bhagavan says in this verse that we should simply be a witness to all things, He does not mean that we should remain like the sun, unattached to and unconcerned with whatever happens or does not happen in our presence. This is why He also says in this verse, ‘remain aloof from them’, for one who is truly aloof from something will not be in the least concerned with that thing and will not attend to it. So long as one attends to something, it means that one is concerned with that thing, in other words, that one is attached to it. That is why in the work <em>Who am I?</em> Sri Bhagavan defines non-attachment, the state of remaining aloof from the non-Self, thus, “Not attending to what-is-other [<em>anya</em>] is non-attachment [<em>vairagya</em>] or desirelessness [<em>nirasa</em>]”.</p>
<p id = "para-1381">However, unfortunately nowadays many writers and lecturers who have merely read the Vedantic scriptures but have never understood the correct practice by which one can separate oneself from the non-Self, recommend to people that one should witness or observe [that is, attend to] all that happens. Thus they have created a false belief in the minds of many aspirants that to witness or observe objects is a <em>Jnana-sadhana</em>, and that by so witnessing things one can detach oneself from them. In truth, however, such objective attention is only a means of becoming attached to objects, and can never be a means of becoming detached from them. That is why Sri Bhagavan has taught that Self-enquiry, which is an attention to the first person or subject [i.e. a non-objective attention], is the sole means of knowing Self and thereby detaching oneself form the non-Self.</p>

In this verse, however, Sri Bhagavan uses <em>upavasa</em> in its literal sense, and He uses another word, <em>unnavratam</em>, for fasting.</p>
<p id = "para-1392"><b>678.

<p id = "para-1393"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The true fasting is not refraining from feeding the stomach, but refraining from feeding the five senses [by not providing them with the objects of pleasure].

However, just as the secret aim of the mother is to give the medicine to her son when he comes into the house, so the secret aim of the <em>Vedas</em> is to prepare and mature people for the <em>Jnana Kanda</em> by first bringing them to the path of righteousness.

When the false name and form are thus given up as a mirageimagination, what remains are the true aspects [s_atya amsas_], namely existence, consciousness and bliss. Since these three, which are the distinguishing features of Self, are the reality of the world, realizing them is <em>puraka</em>. Ever abiding in that realization is <em>kumbhaka</em>. That is, destroying the tendencies towards the world [<em>loka-vasanas</em>], realizing Self and ever abiding as It, is the import of <em>Jnana-pranayama</em>. Though <em>sat</em>, <em>chit</em> and <em>ananda</em> are named as if three different things, in experience they are truly one and the same. In this context, refer also to verse 979 of this work.</p>
<p id = "para-1454"><b>701. Completely giving up the notion ‘I am the body’ is_rechaka_; diving within through the subtle scrutiny ‘Who am I?’ is <em>puraka</em>; and abiding as one with Self as ‘I am That’ is <em>kumbhaka</em> – such is <em>jnana-pranayama</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1455"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In the previous verse it was said that giving up the names and forms of the world is <em>rechaka</em>.

Since existence, consciousness and bliss are not really three different things but the one Self alone, ever abiding as Self is here said to be the correct <em>kumbhaka</em>.

<p id = "para-1472"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: After seeing the following verse composed by Sri Muruganar [which is a <em>venba</em>, a four line verse], Sri Bhagavan composed the above verse [which is a <em>kural venba</em>, a two line verse] giving the same idea in a terser form.</p>
<p id = "para-1473"><b>706. For those who cannot dive deep within throughsilence, the keenest knowledge, seeking “What is the source from which the ‘I’ rises?”, it is better to scrutinize while mentally doing <em>japa</em> wherefrom the supreme Word [<em>para-vak</em>] comes.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1474"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In the above two verses, Sri Bhagavan has explained the secret behind the second of the two instructions which he gave to Kavyakantha Ganapati Sastri on 18th November 1907.</p>
<p id = "para-1475">When Ganapati Sastri approached Sri Bhagavan and prayed for instructions concerning the nature of true <em>tapas</em>, Sri Bhagavan at first remained silent and quietly gazed at him for about fifteen minutes. Then Ganapati Sastri again prayed, “I have read about such <em>mouna-upadesa</em> in <em>sastras</em>, but I am unable to understand it. Graciously instruct me through speech also”. The first instruction then given by Sri Bhagavan was His basic teaching [<em>yathartha upadesa</em>] ‘Who am I?’, that is, to attend to the source from which ‘I’ rises. But being bewildered by the novelty of this <em>upadesa</em>, Ganapati Sastri again asked, “Can that same state be achieved through <em>japa</em> also?” Therefore, seeing that the devotee had a great liking for <em>japa</em>, Sri Bhagavan gave His second instruction, namely “If one repeats a <em>mantra</em> and if one watches wherefrom the sound of that <em>mantra</em> starts, there the mind will subside; that is <em>tapas</em>.”</p>
<p id = "para-1476">When a rupee coin with a head printed on one side and a flower printed on the other side is shown to a small child and when his father asks him, “Which coin do you prefer, the one with a head or the one with a flower?”, whether the child asks for the head or the flower he will be given the same coin by this father, who will simply turn up whichever side the child likes. Just as the father thereby makes his son happy, so Sri Bhagavan made Ganapati Sastri happy by giving him the same instruction a second time in a different form. How? From where else does the sound of a <em>mantra</em> start, except from the person who repeats it? Therefore, watching the source from which the sound of the <em>mantra</em> starts means nothing but attending to ‘I’, the first person, who is doing the <em>japa</em>. Thus, gently hiding the fact that His second <em>upadesa</em> was the same as His first, Sri Bhagavan gave His devotee the same rupee coin [Self-enquiry] with the other side turned up, as if He were recommending <em>japa-sadhana</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1477">The fact that Sri Bhagavan was in an indirect way recommending only Self-enquiry even in his second instruction, as explained in this note, is confirmed in this verse by the words <em>‘para-vak’</em>, for in verse 715 Sri Bhagavan explains that <em>para-vak</em> means nothing but ‘I-I’.</p>
<p id = "para-1478"><b>707. Since you yourself are the form of <em>japa</em>, if you enquire ‘Who am I?’ and know your nature, ah, you will find that the <em>japa</em> which you were doing previously with effort will be ever going on effortlessly and untiringly in the heart.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1479"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Of all the names of God, the soundless name ‘I’, the first person singular consciousness, is the foremost. Since God shines equally and as one in all living beings, and since all living beings refer to themselves as ‘I’, it is clear that ‘I’ is the true nature of God. That is why Sri Bhagavan says, “You yourself [the Selfconsciousness ‘I’] are the form of <em>japa</em>”. Since the doership in the form of effort is destroyed when one’s own nature is scrutinized through the enquiry ‘Who am I?’, the <em>sahaja japa</em> [that is, the ever-shining Self-consciousness ‘I-I’] which then continues without effort is what this verse declares ‘will be ever going on effortlessly and untiringly in the heart’.</p>
<p id = "para-1480"><b>708. Until the objects known merge completely in theknowing subject [i.e. until the sense-knowledges – dyads and triads – merge into the mind and become non-existent] and until one firmly knows what the nature of the true Self is, what use is it to say vainly by mouth, “I am God, I am God”?</b></p>
<p id = "para-1481"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since before knowing Self one identifies oneself with the body, if one says ‘I am God’ it will amount to saying that the body is God, which is not only untrue but also dangerous, for it will increase one’s false sense of egoism. Therefore, before one gives up the identification with the body, it is meaningless and useless to repeat the <em>Mahavakyas</em> such as ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’ and ‘I am He’. Moreover, since after knowing Self one abides as <em>Brahman</em> [God] alone, it is unnecessary for one to repeat ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>, I am <em>Brahman</em>’, just as it is unnecessary for a man to repeat ‘I am a man, I am a man’. Hence, doing <em>japa</em> of the <em>Mahavakyas</em> is dangerous before Self-realization and is unnecessary after Self-realization.</p>
<p id = "para-1482"><b>709. Instead of wandering about repeating [doing <em>japa</em> of] ‘I am the Supreme’, quietly abide as the Supreme. Not by loudly shouting ‘I am That’, but only by abiding as ‘I am That’, will the miseries [of birth and death] go away.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1483"><b>710. Diseases will not be cured merely by repeating thename of the medicine, but only by drinking the medicine. Likewise, the bonds of birth [and death] will not leave us merely by doing <em>japa</em> of many <em>Mahavakyas</em> such as ‘I am Siva’ [<em>Sivoham</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1484"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: What is signified by the phrase ‘by drinking the medicine’ is not mentioned in this verse, but since the previous verse instructs us ‘quietly abide as the Supreme’, we should understand that ‘drinking the medicine’ means only ‘abiding as the Supreme’.</p>

Its aim is only to make them understand the limitation of such worship and to help them go further by turning their attention Selfwards. However, it is clear from verse 208 of this work that Sri Bhagavan does not condemn temple-worship, which has its own value so long as the aspirant identifies his body as ‘I’.</p>

Compare this with the holy words of Sri Bhagavan in the 2nd verse of <em>Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam</em>, “Since you shine as ‘I’ in the Heart, Your name itself is Heart”.</p>
<p id = "para-1493"><b>713. Since alone with ‘I’, the aforesaid first name [of God],‘am’ always shines as the light of the Reality ‘I’, ‘am’ is also [an equally great] name [of God].</b></p>

<p id = "para-1497"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since it is clear from this verse that what Sri Bhagavan means by the word <em>‘para-vak’</em> is only the <em>atma-sphurana</em> ‘I-I’, the reader can understand that what He meant when He said in verse Bhagavan-12 [B12, above 706], of this work, “<em>vak parai ar stanam terdal</em>” [to know the place where the <em>para-vak</em> shines], was ‘to attend to the source where ‘I-I’ shines’, which is nothing but the method of Self-enquiry.

<p id = "para-1505"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: He who identifies himself with the body and who feels ‘I am so-and-so’ is the <em>jiva</em> or ego, who is denoted by the term ‘thou’ [<em>twam</em>].

<p id = "para-1547"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Dhyana</em> is mental activity, an act of imagination by the mind, while <em>vichara</em> is the state of the destruction of the mind [<em>mano-nasa</em>]. The idea expressed in this verse can also be found in prose form in <em>Who am I?</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1548"><b>739. Whoever meditates upon Self in whatever <em>bhava</em> [i.e. in whatever form or with whatever feeling of relationship], attains It only in that <em>bhava</em> [i.e. in a qualified or <em>saguna</em> manner]. Those peaceful ones who remain quiet without any such <em>bhava</em>, attain the noble and unqualified state of <em>Kaivalya</em> [the <em>nirguna</em> state of Self].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1549"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is emphasised in this verse that by meditating on God in name and form, one attains God only in that name and form, and that only by remaining still [through Self-enquiry] without thinking or meditating, can one attain the unqualified [<em>nirguna</em>] state of God, the state of oneness [<em>Kaivalya</em>]. From this verse, the reader can understand the correct import of verse 8 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1550"><b>740. One’s source [the Self] can be attained only after oneself, the ego [the separate individuality], has been completely annihilated. How to meditate ‘I am That’ by the ego?

<p id = "para-1551"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Verse 32 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> should be studied along with this verse. In the previous verse Sri Bhagavan instructed that worshipping God in name and form will not give the unqualified [<em>nirguna</em>] state, the final attainment. In this verse He instructs that even the practice of meditation upon the <em>Mahavakyas</em> such as ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’, which was wrongly believed by people up till now to be meditation on the unqualified [<em>nirguna-upasana</em>], will not give the final state, since it is nothing but a mere mental act of imagination. Sri Bhagavan asserts that silent Self-abidance, which is the correct technique of Self-enquiry, alone will give the final attainment. <b>741. The reason why one sees Siva as ‘This [form] is He’ by meditating upon Him as if He were one among the sense-objects – though [in fact] He shines as the formless consciousness – and why one laments [when that form disappears], is because of the folly of not knowing oneself by enquiring ‘Who am I?’</b></p>
<p id = "para-1552"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Refer here to verse 1070, 1072 and 1073 of this work.</p>
<p id = "para-1553">Some aspirants meditate upon Siva in a particular form. When, through the strength of that meditation (<em>bhava-bala</em>), they see Him in that form as an object of sight, they believe that they have attained <em>Siva-darshan</em>. But whatever appears at one time will surely disappear at another time, and hence the aspirant will have to lament when the form of his beloved Siva disappears. However, since Siva is in reality the formless, pure consciousness which shines within as ‘I’, if the aspirant wishes to attain a <em>darshan</em> of Siva which will never disappear, he need only enquire within ‘Who am I, the seer of this vision?’ and thereby realize Self.</p>

<p id = "para-1560"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Some people, with an eye on some desired results, meditate not upon any of the names and forms of God, but upon the vast space. Even by such practices, desires are fulfilled.</p>
<p id = "para-1561"><b>744. Among those who meditate upon space, only thosewho then give up that meditation upon vast space [by enquiring ‘Who am I who meditates upon space?’] will attain the [true] greatness of birthlessness. Others will fall into the cycle of birth and death.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1562"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is to be understood that the phrase ‘attain whatever greatness one desires’ used in the previous verse denotes only the fulfilment of worldly desires [<em>kamyas</em>], whereas the phrase ‘attain the greatness of birthlessness’ used in the present verse denotes the attainment of Liberation.</p>
<p id = "para-1563">Though space is not a name and form like that of God, it also has a name [namely space] and a form [namely vastness] of its own. Besides, it is a second person object. Therefore, in this verse it is advised that one should give up such an object of meditation and turn towards Self by enquiring ‘Who am I who know this space?’ Self is the only target of meditation which will bestow the supreme state of birthlessness and deathlessness.</p>
<p id = "para-1564"><b>745. To say that one who practised Self-abidance [<em>nishtha</em>] by clinging to the Lord, Self, the form of consciousness, lost his balance of mind and became insane, is just like saying that by drinking the nectar of immortality one died. Know thus.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1565"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: It is wrong to say, as worldly people sometimes do, that someone has become mad by following the path of Self-enquiry. In this verse Sri Bhagavan assures us that one will never suffer from any such mental disorder by following this path, and that on the contrary one will achieve greater clarity and strength of mind.</p>

<p id = "para-1569"><b>746. If you desire to attain the eternal greatness devoid ofthe defect of birth and death, the correct <em>sadhana</em> is to meditate upon that time [namely the presen]) which does not have the least modification of coming and going.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1570"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If we scrutinize the meaning of this verse in the light of verse 15 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “The past and future exist depending upon the present; they too, while occurring were and will be present. Therefore, [among the three times] the present alone exists...”, we can understand that what is denoted here by the phrase ‘that time which does not have the least modification of coming or going’ is only the present. Thus this verse gives us the rare clue that <em>atma-sadhana</em> can be done not only in the form of attending to the first person [out of the three persons], but also in the form of attending to the present [out of the three times]. In whichever of these two forms one may do the <em>atma-sadhana</em>, both the first person and the present time will disappear, being found to be truly non-existent, and the eternal greatness devoid of birth and death will be attained. Refer also to <em>The Path of Sri Ramana</em> – Part One, pages 135 to 136, where this idea is explained more fully.</p>
<p id = "para-1571"><b>747. Those who have given up that conception [the conception of time] – having known [by attending to the present as instructed in the previous verse] that time is nothing but Self [just as the apparent snake is nothing but a rope] – are the great ones who attain deathlessness. All others will die, slain by the sword of time.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1572"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse it is indicated that the present time and the first person are similar in nature. When one scrutinizes or meditates either upon ‘I’ [the ego, the first person or first place] or upon the present [the first time], the ego and the present will disappear, being found to be non-existent, and our real existence-consciousness [<em>sat-chit</em>], ‘I am’, which transcends time and space, alone will remain. This is what is meant by the phrase “have given up even the conception of time” used by Sri Bhagavan in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-1573">It is worth noting here the warning given by Sri Bhagavan in the alternative version of verse 16 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, where He says, “Except ‘we’, where is time? If, without scrutinizing ourself, we mistake the body to be ‘we’, time will swallow us...”. The same idea is expressed in the present verse by the sentence, “All others will die, slain by the sword of time”.</p>
<p id = "para-1574"><b>748. Those who are firmly established in their own state[of Self-existence], never see any such thing as time, but only their own Self. They will no longer know the one whole reality [<em>tattva</em>] as the three different times [present, past and future].</b></p>

<p id = "para-1579"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Three points are to be inferred from this verse, namely (1) the world has no real existence, and appears to exist only on account of non-enquiry (<em>avichara</em>), (2) birth and death are mere thoughts, and (3) when one realises Self, that itself is crossing the ocean of birth and death.</p>
<p id = "para-1580">The last two lines of this verse are a verse from the chapter ‘Knowing the Truth’ in the section ‘Concerning Renunciation’ in the <em>Tirukkural</em>. The way in which this verse of <em>Tirukkural</em> is handled by Sri Muruganar in the present verse is both apt and beautiful.</p>
<p id = "para-1581"><b>750. Whatever one thinks of unceasingly [until one’sdeath], by the power of such thinking one becomes that.

<p id = "para-1582"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: It is said in scriptures that one becomes whatever one thinks of at the time the life leaves the body. Therefore, in this verse it is instructed that those who want Liberation should think about Self in order to set aside other thoughts, which are the cause of rebirth. Since death can come at any time, any second of our life may be the second prior to death. Therefore, it is Sri Bhagavan’s opinion that meditation on Self should be done every second.</p>
<p id = "para-1583"><b>751. Perfect and peaceful clarity is what the <em>Vedas</em> declare to be the ultimate goal of <em>tapas</em>.

<p id = "para-1586"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Ignorant people often think that they have obtained God’s Grace merely because they are provided with different kinds of worldly well-being such as wealth and health. But these are not the correct signs of God’s Grace, since they are given to one merely because of one’s own <em>punyas</em>, that is, they are the result of <em>prarabdha</em>. The state of <em>Jnana</em>, in which one knows Self and thereby abides in unbroken peace, devoid of miseries, alone is the true sign of God’s Grace. It is also to be noted here that the peaceful clarity of Self-consciousness, which was said in verse 751 to be “the ultimate goal of <em>tapas</em>”, is said in this verse to be the true sign of God’s Grace.</p>

<p id = "para-1588"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Rather than achieving whatever one desires, to have no desire at all is the perfect state of happiness.

<p id = "para-1630"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The knowledge ‘I am this body, I am so-and-so’ is not the correct and true knowledge of oneself; it is only the ego, the false sense of individuality. Knowing oneself merely as ‘I am is I am’, without any adjunct such as ‘this’ or ‘that’, is the true knowledge. When Moses saw God in the form of a flame of fire, he asked Him who He was, and God replied, “I AM THAT I AM”; Sri Bhagavan often used to point out this sentence from the Old Testament, which is the only sentence in the Bible the whole of which is printed in capital letters.</p>
<p id = "para-1631"><b>776. Since the defectless Supreme Reality, which is thetrue knowledge, shines as the primal, one and perfect Whole, to rise as an individual separate from the Lord – who cannot be defined as ‘He is this’ – even in order to worship Him is wrong.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1632"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Non-dual union is the state of perfect love; separation shows a deficiency in love. Hence, however much one worships the Lord after separating oneself from Him as an individual, all such worship shows a deficiency in one’s love for Him.

<p id = "para-1633"><b>777. To rise up forcefully as the jumping and sufferingfalse ‘I’ different from the Reality, the unbroken space of</b> <em>Jnana</em><b>, is the sin of cutting into two parts and slaying the highest [non-dual] <em>dharma</em> [namely <em>Brahman</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1634"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Dividing the one, unbroken <em>Brahman</em> into two, a soul who worships and a God who is worshipped, is here said to be committing the heinous sin of <em>Brahma-hatti</em> [killing <em>Brahman</em>].</p>

<p id = "para-1636"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The state of Self alone is real, and it exists and shines devoid of knowledge and ignorance, since there is no other thing for it to know or to be ignorant of, and devoid of movement, since it is the unbroken Whole. On the other hand, that which appears as a world of multiplicity and as a <em>jiva</em> which knows that multiplicity and moves in it, is nothing but a mental delusion and is not real. Thus this verse teaches us that the one Self, which is <em>Ajata</em> devoid of creating or being created], alone is the Reality.</p>
<p id = "para-1637"><b>779. The nature of bondage is merely the rising, ruinousthought ‘I am different from the reality’. Since one surely cannot remain separate from the reality, reject that thought whenever it rises.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1638"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Is it not by conceiving an imaginary boundary line in the undivided sheet of the Indian Ocean that we determine ‘This is the Bay of Bengal’? This line is merely a thought. In truth the ocean has never been divided. An imaginary form whose limit is determined by this thought, becomes the Bay of Bengal. Likewise, it is only because the existence-consciousness ‘I’ is wrongly imagined as ‘I am limited to this body’ that the feeling ‘I am a limited and bound individual, separate from the Self’ comes into existence. Is not this bondage merely a thought or an imagination? Hence, since Liberation from bondage is only the removal of the first thought ‘I am the body’, this verse instructs that one should remove that thought by <em>vichara</em> whenever it rises.</p>
<p id = "para-1639"><b>780. Leaving the state of Self, do not think any thought[even the first thought, ‘I’]; if you do, repent for it and do not commit the same folly again. “Do nothing for which you will repent; if you do, it is better not to do such a thing again.”</b></p>
<p id = "para-1640"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The last two lines of this verse are verse 655 of <em>Tirukkural</em>, in which Tiruvalluvar talks about the wrongs that a man does. But since all wrongs are committed only after committing the primal wrong of rising as ‘I am a man, an individual called so-and-so’, Sri Bhagavan does not merely recommend a way of rectifying other wrongs, but instead He teaches that one should not at all allow the thought ‘I am a man’ to rise, and that if one once allows it to rise, one should at least repent for it and should not allow it to rise again. Thus Sri Bhagavan deals with the very root of the problem and shows us how to remove the poison in its nascent state.</p>
<p id = "para-1641"><b>781. Be not disheartened thinking, “When shall I attain thebliss of <em>yoga</em>, the state of Self?”, for the true state of Self-knowledge shines ever the same without [the condition of] a time or a space such as far or near.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1642"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since Self is God, Self-abidance is itself the supreme <em>yoga</em>. For those who have renounced everything only for the sake of obtaining the bliss of consciousness [<em>chit-ananda</em>], the supreme wealth of Grace, the thought in the form of excessive longing itself becomes an obstacle to their attaining it. The difference in times such as past and future and in space, such as far and near, exist only in the mental world of imagination and not in the real world of Self. Therefore Sri Bhagavan says, “Do not lament, ‘Ah, when shall I be united with Self?’,” for it is better to spend in Self-attention that time which one spends in such lamenting.</p>
<p id = "para-1643"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The words ‘ever the same’ used in Tamil original may also mean ‘ever united’ or ‘ever attained’. Verses 15 and 16 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, which reveal the unreality of time and space, may also be read here.</p>

<p id = "para-1645"><em>(Mula Munaiva Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-1646"><b>782. Enquiring ‘What is our birth-place [source]?’ andthereby knowing and reaching that birth-place, is the best of all paths to root out miseries, which can exist only in the place you have entered [and not in the place you were born].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1647"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: From this verse we have to understand the following: The state of Self is our birth-place, and the state of individuality [<em>jivatman</em>], in which the mind, body and world appear, is the place we have entered. In the state of Self there are no miseries; it is only in the state of individuality that all kinds of miseries such as birth and death and all kinds of vices such as desire, can exist. In order to root out all such miseries and defects, Self-enquiry is the best path.</p>
<p id = "para-1648">Since a girl has all her rights and all possibilities for enjoying life only in her husband’s home, the place she has entered by marriage, it is a common worldly custom to advise her, “Leave your birth-place and go to the place you have entered [i.e. go to your husband’s home]”. But quite contrary to such worldly advice, in this verse Sri Bhagavan advises spiritual aspirants, “Miseries exist only in the place you have entered, so in order to remove all miseries, go back to your birth-place”.</p>
<p id = "para-1649"><b>783. O [foolish] mind who wanders [outside] searching [for happiness], not knowing that the state of Liberation is your own right, if you go back the way you came [out], but that way you will regain the state of Liberation, the unending perfect happiness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1650"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: We should know that the state of our own Self is Liberation, the eternal happiness, and it is ever our own right. We experience miseries only because we turn our attention outwards, leaving Self. Therefore, the <em>sadhana</em> to achieve the seemingly lost happiness is just to turn our attention back towards Self, the source from which we rose and came out as a <em>jiva</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1651"><b>784. Until one’s own subsidence in the Heart [Self], thecentre [of all], is experienced, the five sense-knowledges will not subside even a little, and until the delusive five sense-knowledges are completely extinguished, happiness, the knowledge of the reality, will not be attained.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1652"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The note for verse 604 is also to be read here. The removal of <em>ajnana</em> and the dawn of <em>Jnana</em> are not two separate actions, they are one and the same. Thinking these to be two separate actions, one should not be bewildered wondering which is to happen first.</p>
<p id = "para-1653">The <em>jiva</em> always has the freedom to desire the loss of individuality or ego. Therefore, it is sufficient if the liking for the non-rising of the ego arises in one’s Heart; be sure that the liking will be fulfilled by Grace.</p>
<p id = "para-1654"><b>785. O mind, instead of looking at and thereby worryingabout that which is imagined [the world], turn towards your source and enter the Heart. In that supreme state of consciousness, all [that you were seeking before] will become the one non-dual Self, your real nature.</b></p>

When it is said that even the mere slipping down from[abidance in] the state of the pure non-dual Self is a crime for those who have started to do their duty [namely the true <em>tapas</em> of Self-abidance], will it on consideration be proper for them to interfere in the affairs of others?</b></p>
<p id = "para-1658"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In verse 266 of <em>Tirukkural</em>, Tiruvalluvar says, “Those who do <em>tapas</em> alone are those who do their duties”. Therefore, the foremost duty or <em>dharma</em> of an aspirant is to do the true <em>tapas</em> of attending to and abiding in Self. Hence slackness in Self-attention is slipping down from one’s duty or <em>dharma</em>; in other words, attending to other things is the sin of <em>adharma</em>. When it is so, how much more sinful will it be if an aspirant interferes in the affairs of others?</p>
<p id = "para-1659"><b>787. If one always sees only the good qualities in othersinstead of seeing any bad, one’s life will be very pleasant, having no room for any disgust.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1660"><b>788. Unless one follows the principle, “That which isessential to be reformed is only my own mind”, one’s mind will become more and more impure by seeing the defects of others.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1661"><b>789. O mind, it is not because you have attained egoless,sweet qualities that Great Ones are kind towards you; it is only because of their greatness of forgiving all your accumulated defects without minding them. Know thus.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1662"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: “I have achieved very high qualities and merits, and that is why even Great Ones are very kind to me” – thinking thus, one should not have a high estimate of one’s own merits and maturity. The Great Ones are always kind to us because they are able to forgive us, ignoring all our bad qualities. Therefore, like them, we should also forgive others for the wrongs they do to us and should always be kind to them.</p>
<p id = "para-1663"><b>790. To err is human nature; yet if those who are strong inhaving virtuous behaviour err, it is good for them to admit their errors and to reform themselves, instead of hiding them in order to maintain their prestige.</b></p>

<p id = "para-1665"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: All <em>niyamas</em> are prescribed only to develop the <em>sattvic</em> quality in the mind. Since it is only through a <em>sattvic</em> mind that one can understand that Self-enquiry alone is the real <em>sadhana</em>, the <em>niyamas</em> will help one only up to that extent. Then when the aspirant takes to the practice of Self-enquiry, whatever <em>niyamas</em> are found to be standing as a hindrance to <em>vichara</em> should at once be given up by him. Since the rising of an ‘I’ is necessary to observe <em>niyamas</em>, and since in <em>vichara</em> this ‘I’ should not be allowed to rise at all, the <em>niyamas</em> will leave the aspirant of their own accord, like withered leaves falling from a tree.</p>
<p id = "para-1666"><b>792. When whatever you desire is obtained as you desire,do not think that it is due to the power of your <em>tapas</em>. Knowing that it is because of God’s Grace, love his Feet more and more.</b></p>

<p id = "para-1668"><b>794. The fruit of [the Guru’s] making a failure of one’sefforts is to make one understand that only by the Guru’s Grace and not merely by one’s own effort can <em>Siddhi</em> [the attainment of Self-knowledge] be obtained, and [thereby] to prepare one to seek the Guru’s Grace.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1669"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The annihilation of the ego is the aim of all spiritual <em>sadhanas</em>. But if it appears as if there is success in an aspirants efforts, will there not be room for that ego to sprout out again and wax with more strength at least in the form ‘I have done great <em>tapas</em> and succeeded’? Therefore, in order to prevent any such thing from happening, even in the earnest efforts of an aspirant failures are many times made to occur by the Guru’s Grace.</p>

For those who, like Dattatreya, the son of Atri Maharshi, can learn a lesson from everything [in this world], on account of their mind being not crooked and perverted [but straightforward], the whole life in the world will be a <em>gurukulam</em> [a learning centre].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1671"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In <em>Srimat Bhagavatam</em> it is said that the sage Dattatreya learnt twenty-four good principles from twenty-four things which he came across in this world.

<p id = "para-1677"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: What is here called quietude is the state of stillness of mind. This can be achieved only by unceasing enquiry [<em>vichara</em>]. When the mind knows that in truth there is nothing to reject or to accept, it will lose its movements [<em>chalana</em>] and will abide in supreme peace [<em>parama-santi</em>]. Since such peace is the seed of the natural [<em>sahaja</em>] state, it is here said to be the “deathless life” [<em>amara vazhu</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-1678"><b>797. Agitation is the trouble-giving enemy; agitation drivesone to do heinous sins; agitation is drunkenness; agitation of mind is the deep, dark pit.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1679"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since the rapid movement of very subtle thoughts is itself misery, that agitation is described here as drunkenness and as a heinous enemy. Since all the inner enemies such as desire, anger and pride are nothing but the subtle movements of thoughts, he who has destroyed that movement will from that time be devoid of all kinds of enemies, heinous sins, miseries and the pit of ignorance.</p>

<p id = "para-1681"><em>(Sishya Achara Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-1682"><b>798. Yet, the duty of a disciple is, even in dream, to followsteadfastly and to abide by the worthy teaching given from His immortal experience by the Guru, who shines with the highest divine quality, that of uncaused Grace [<em>avyaja Karuna</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1683"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The word ‘yet’ which starts this verse, alludes to the same yet which is used in the following passage of ‘<em>Who am I?</em>’: “Just as the prey that has fallen into the jaws of a tiger cannot esape, so those who have come under the glance of the Guru’s Grace will surely be saved and will never be forsaken; Yet, one should follow without fail the path shown by the Guru”.</p>
<p id = "para-1684"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: See verse 284.</p>
<p id = "para-1685"><b>799. Though those who steadfastly follow the path to Salvation may sometimes have to swerve from the Vedic codes, either due to forgetfulness or due to any other reason [such as poverty or disease], they should never go against the words of the Guru.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1686"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Though the <em>Vedas</em> were given by God Himself, for the sake of those who have followed the <em>Vedas</em> through so many lives and who have thereby achieved maturity of mind He finally takes the form of the Guru by His Grace and teaches the path of Self-enuiry so that they may attain non-dual union with Him and thereby enjoy Him, the supreme bliss. When God thus comes in the form of the Guru, His words are to be taken by the disciple as more important and sacred than the words of the <em>Vedas</em>, because the words of the Guru are instructions given to him in his state of maturity whereas the words of the <em>Vedas</em> were instructions given to him to suit his then state of immaturity. Hence in this verse it is implied that if any of the rules of the <em>Vedas</em> stand as obstacles to Self-enquiry, even the words of the <em>Vedas</em> should be given up.</p>
<p id = "para-1687"><b>800. The words of Sages say that if one does wrong[<em>apacharam</em>] to God, it can be rectified by the Guru, but an <em>apacharam</em> done to the Guru cannot be rectified even by God.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1688"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: The words ‘Vedic codes’ [<em>veda-neri</em>] mean the observances [<em>acharas</em>] and so on prescribed in the <em>Vedas</em>. For those who swerve from the words of the Guru, even if one swerves from the Vedic codes one should never disobey the Guru’s words.</p>
<p id = "para-1689">Thus it is stressed that devotion to the Guru is greater than devotion to God.</p>
<p id = "para-1690"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: When verse 801 was shown to Sri Bhagavan, He composed a verse of His own conveying the same meaning. This verse of Sri Bhagavan is given below as verse B14, and is also included in <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em> as verse 39. Since the meaning of these two verses, which are translations of verse 87 of Sri Adi Sankara’s work <em>Tattvopadesa</em>, is the same, only a translation of verse B14 is given here.</p>
<p id = "para-1691"><b>B14. O son, always have [the experience of] non-duality [<em>advaita</em>] in the Heart, but never express non-duality in action. Non-duality may be applied towards the three worlds, but know that non-duality should never be applied towards the Guru.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1692"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The three worlds are <em>Brahma Loka</em>, <em>Vishnu Loka</em> and <em>Siva Loka</em>, and applying non-duality towards the three worlds means having a mental attitude ‘I am not different from Brahma, from Vishnu or from Siva’. However, so long as one’s ego or individuality survives, one should not have the attitude ‘I am not different from the Guru’, since such an attitude would be a mere act of imagination and would make one’s ego wax all the more. Thus this verse stresses the same idea as verse 800, namely that whatever wrong one may do to God, one should never do any wrong to the Guru, for the Guru is to be regarded as more sacred even than God.</p>
<p id = "para-1693"><b>71 Kindness to <em>Jivas</em></b></p>

<p id = "para-1697"><b>B15. Only one who is saved can save other <em>jivas</em>, whereas others are like the blind leading the blind.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1698"><b>803. A <em>Jnani</em> who, having destroyed the ego, abides in the state of Self, which is <em>Jnana</em>, bestows Self-knowledge upon those who, troubled by miseries, come to Him with faith by destroying the delusion of their body-identification; His doing so is [the real] kindness to <em>jivas</em> [<em>jiva-karunya</em>]. All other kinds of kindness are of no avail [and hence are not at all real kindness].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1699"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse clearly stresses that bestowing Self-knowledge alone is real kindness in the name of charity, philanthropy or <em>jiva-karunya</em> – even trying to heavenize the world – is not at all real kindness. Since the state of being a <em>jiva</em> is itself the greatest misery, the real kindness to <em>jivas</em> is the <em>Sadguru’s</em> bestowing upon them Self-knowledge and thereby removing their _jiva_hood and granting them _Siva_hood.</p>
<p id = "para-1700">Let us suppose that a man is dreaming that he and his comrades have been attacked by a tiger. Some of his comrades are wounded and the tiger is about to attack again, so the man calls out in his dream asking someone to bring a rifle and a first-aid-box. His shouting is heard by a friend who is awake. Now what is the truly kind and useful help that the waking friend can give to the dreaming man? Will it be of any use if he brings a rifle and a first-aid-box? If he merely taps the man and wakes him up, will that not be the best help, both to the dreaming man and his wounded comrades?</p>
<p id = "para-1701">All the miseries of a <em>jiva</em> are experienced by him in a dream which is occurring in the long sleep of Self-forgetfulness, and hence his waking up from that dream is the only solution for all his miseries. Since the <em>jiva</em> can be awakened to Self-knowledge only by someone who is already awake, a <em>Jnani</em> alone can do real good to the <em>jiva</em>. If any <em>ajnani</em> tries to relieve the sufferings of another, he will be just like someone in dream bringing a rifle and first-aid-box; since he does not know the real cause of the dreaming man’s suffering all his help will be just like one blind man leading another blind man.</p>
<p id = "para-1702"><b>804. Since it is said that one must be the doctor for oneself, O doctor, before you come to heal us, first heal yourself and then come to us.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1703"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse paraphrases the English proverb, “Physician, heal thyself”. Though this verse is seemingly addressed to a doctor, it is indirectly addressed to the would-be <em>gurus</em> who have merely read the scriptures and who at once come to the public, climb on the lecture platforms and begin to give instructions. To such people this verse advices, “O preachers who come to give instructions to others without having yourself attained salvation, before you start to prescribe to us the medicine to remove the disease of birth and death, first heal yourself from that disease and then come to heal us”.</p>
<p id = "para-1704"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since Self-knowledge is for all people the only medicine to cure the disease of birth and death, and since no bodily disease can exist without that disease [of birth and death], one should first cure that disease.</p>

<p id = "para-1716"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: There is truly nothing in the world which can be bartered for oneself; though it is so, if it is for the sake of giving even that [selling oneself] should be done.

<p id = "para-1720"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since everyone has great attachment towards his body as ‘I’ and since death separates him from his body, everyone fears death.

<p id = "para-1722"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse it is taught that rather than the <em>rajasic</em> nature which prompts one to attack the strong and wicked person, the <em>sattvic</em> nature which prompts one to help the distressed is more fitting to an aspirant. In this context it is worth remembering how Sri Bhagavan once prevented a devotee from attacking the thieves who had beaten Him and how He was engaged in applying balm on the bruises of the devotees and the dog who had been beaten by the thieves.</p>

<p id = "para-1725"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The ‘righteousness’ mentioned in this verse means compassion to living beings [<em>bhuta daya</em>], which can truly exist only as a result of the fearlessness mentioned in verse 310, namely the fearlessness even in front of death. This fearlessness will dawn in one only when the ignorance ‘I am the body’ is destroyed. Those in whom this ignorance is not destroyed will naturally experience fear due to their attachment to the body. Those in whom this ignorance is not destroyed will naturally experience fear due to their attachment to the body when they see poisonous creatures such as snakes, and will therefore feel a hatred towards them and will beat them to death. In order to instruct that it is wrong to do so, such habits are described in this verse as ‘evil habits’ and ‘contrary to righteousness’, and people who have such habits are described as ‘ignorant and worthless’. Since the very nature of those creatures is to be poisonous and to harm others, they are said to be sin-filled and pitiable. Therefore, even though they do harm to us, to kill them is not a righteous act.</p>
<p id = "para-1726"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Not only creatures like poisonous snakes, but also people who do sinful acts, are unconsciously motivated by inborn hatred. Therefore, however sinful they may be, we should not be angry with them but should only pity them for their ignorance.</p>

Sri Bhagavan stood for some time without moving the leg and said, ‘This punishment is necessary for having caused this trouble [<em>himsa</em>]; accept it,’, and the leg became swollen.

The angry hornets flew out, swarmed around His leg and violently stung only that thigh which had broken their nest. Taking pity on the hornets, Sri Bhagavan said, “Yes, is it not this thigh that broke their nest? Let it be punished”, and patiently allowed His leg to be stung by the hornets. The above verse is Sri Muruganar’s question about this incident, and the next verse is Sri Bhagavan’s answer.</p>

An ashramite objected to her doing so, saying, “It is wrong to stretch one’s legs towards anyone; please fold your legs”. At once Sri Bhagavan, who was sitting on His couch stretching His legs towards the devotees, folded his legs.

<p id = "para-1742"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Just like the sun or the rain, God does not reject anyone.

<p id = "para-1746"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse is an instruction given to some good devotees like Sri Muruganar who came to live in the Ashram, believing it to be a favourable environment for their spiritual progress, but who soon had to leave and live alone outside the Ashram, having found for one reason or another that it was not a suitable environment. When a seemingly good society is thus bound by an advanced aspirant to be unsuitable, he should follow his conscience and live alone, and should not continue to depend in any way upon that society.</p>
<p id = "para-1747">However, it should be noted that in this verse the word ‘conscience’ means only the conscience of an advanced aspirant, which is why it is referred to as a ‘pure conscience’. Since the minds of immature people are often unable to resist their bad tendencies, their conscience may sometimes decide good to be bad and bad to be good, and hence it is not the conscience of such people that is meant here. Rather than being misled by their wrong discrimination, it would be better for such people to follow the advice of their elders.</p>
<p id = "para-1748"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: If one’s conscience, being driven by <em>prarabdha</em>, separates and prevents one from living in a good society, it will be better for a wise aspirant to live alone instead of rejecting his pure conscience by trying to live among the same group of people.</p>

However, in some scriptures such as <em>Kaivalya Navanitham</em> it is said that <em>sattva</em> is the original or primal nature of the mind. Therefore in this verse it is said that in the natural state (<em>sahajasamadhi</em>) even this <em>sattva</em> – the primal nature of the mind – is silent.</p>
<p id = "para-1842"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Though <em>sahaja samadhi</em> is the state transcending all the three <em>gunas</em> [<em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>], since <em>sattva</em> alone is the primal nature of the mind, the phrase <em>‘sattva-mouna’</em> [the silence of <em>sattva</em>] is used here.</p>

<p id = "para-1846"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since Self is in truth that which transcends all roles and all qualities, and since It exists as one without a second, to glorify It as the ‘witness of all’ [<em>sarva-sakshi</em>] or as the ‘knower of all’ [<em>sarvajna</em>] is merely the folly of ignorant people.</p>
<p id = "para-1847"><b>870. If I feel that I see the world, what is the secret behindthis? It is that a world of sense-objects and a seer of it rise in ‘me’, the space of the perfect and true light of unbroken [Self-]Knowledge. Know thus definitely.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1848"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This world-appearance, which is composed of the five sense-knowledges, and the <em>jiva</em> who sees it are not real. They are mere false appearances like a mirage, having Self as their base, and they appear only with the help of the light of Self. Moreover, this world-appearance is not even seen by Self, but only by the <em>jiva</em>, who is himself a part of it. Refer here to verse 7 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, in which Sri Bhagavan says, “Although the world [the objects seen] and the mind [the <em>jiva</em> who sees it] rise and set together, it is [not by Self, but] by the mind alone that the world is seen. [Self, on the other hand, is] the Whole which is the base for [the false appearance of] the world and the mind to rise from and set in, but which Itself shines without rising or setting, [and hence] It alone is the reality.”</p>
<p id = "para-1849"><b>871. The conviction created by the senses that the appearance is real is a mistaken conviction. Know that both the senses, which enable the appearance to be known, and the <em>jiva</em>, the knower of it, are of the same degree of reality as the appearance.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1850"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the knower [the <em>jiva</em>], the known [the worldappearance] and the knowing [the act of perceiving the world through the five senses] form a triad [<em>triputi</em>], all of them are equally false. In other words, since even the <em>jiva</em> who is seen and his act of seeing are both a part of the world-appearance, they are both unreal as that appearance. To illustrate this, let us suppose that a film is taken of a king watching a cinema show; when this film is projected, are not the king and his act of watching the cinema show, both pictures in the film? Refer here to verse 160 and its note.</p>
<p id = "para-1851"><b>872. He who sees the seer [the knower of the mind,namely Self] will shine as the Supreme Self Itself, having destroyed the sense of difference ‘I am different form the seer of the seer’ and having attained his own nature.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1852"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The central idea of this verse is that he who has seen Self will shine as Self, having destroyed his individuality and having attained the non-dual knowledge [<em>advaita-jnana</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-1853">Though in verse 869 and other verses of this work Sri Bhagavan says that it is wrong to ascribe to Self the function of ‘seeing’, in this verse He refers to Self as ‘the seer of the seer’. The reason for this apparent contradiction is that He is here talking from the ordinary level of understanding – the same level of understanding on which most ancient scriptures such as <em>Drik-Drisya Viveka</em> were given. Therefore the reader should understand the expression ‘the seer of the seer’ to be figurative and not literal.</p>

<p id = "para-1857"><b>875. When seen not through the petty ‘I’ but through theinfinite ‘I’, everything is known to be within Self, the real Supreme. Know that, just like the appearance of many different objects in a dream, Self alone is seen as other things [the world].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1858"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: What is seen in dream appears only for the one who sleeps.

<p id = "para-1862"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since the word ‘world’ [<em>loka</em>] literally means ‘that which is seen’, the phrase ‘the knowledge of the world’ used in this verse denotes objective knowledge, the seeing-knowledge which appears with <em>triputi-bheda</em> [the difference of the seer, the seeing and the seen].

However, the world seen in front of the eyes is not perceived directly, since it is known only through the medium of the mind and the five senses. Self, the knowledge of one’s own existence, is a more real and more direct knowledge than the knowledge of any alien object.

If the ego is destroyed, that alone will be sufficient, for it will be equivalent to attaining Self.</p>

<p id = "para-1877"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: After crossing a river, ten fools began to count themselves to see whether they had already crossed safely. But while counting each one forgot to count himself, and so they each counted only nine, which led them to believe that one of them had drowned in the river. Seeing their distress, a wayfarer understood that their misery was only due to their having forgotten to count themselves, so he said, “I will give each of you one blow, and you must each count aloud as you receive your blow”. As soon as the tenth man received his blow and counted “Ten,” they all exclaimed, “Yes, we are ten after all. Our lost companion has been found.” In truth, however, the tenth man was not newly gained, for he had never really been lost. Likewise, the experience of Self is not to be newly gained.

<p id = "para-1881"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Just as the woman had in fact never lost her necklace, so in truth Self is never unknown.

<p id = "para-1882"><b>885. Except by [the effort made through] the path ofenquiring into the mysterious sense, [the ego], by whatever effort is made through other paths such as <em>karma</em>, it is impossible to attain and enjoy Self, the treasure shining in the heart.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1883"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse Sri Bhagavan clearly and emphatically gives His verdict that however much one may strive on whatever other path such as <em>karma, yoga</em>, <em>bhakti</em> or <em>jnana</em>, one cannot attain the bliss of Self until one enquires ‘Who am I who strive in these other paths?’ Compare verse 14 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> – <em>Anubandham</em> here.</p>
<p id = "para-1884"><b>886. If that unequalled state which is to be experienced infuture through <em>tapas</em> in the form of [the six steps of] <em>sama</em> and so on is a real state, it should exist [and be experienced] even now as much as then.</b></p>
<p id = "para-1885"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: If we were to say that we do not experience Self now and that we will experience it only at some time in the future, it would amount to saying that Self is non-existent at one time and existent at another time.

Therefore, since it does not exist in all the three times [past, present and future], how can it be called a real thing [<em>sat vastu</em>]? Hence, since Self-knowledge is the reality, it should be understood to be here, now, ever-attained [<em>nitya-siddha</em>] and diectly experienced [<em>pratyaksha</em>]. The same idea is also expressed in the next verse.</p>
<p id = "para-1886"><b>887. If that state does not exist now but will come [intoexistence] only later, that state which will come cannot be our natural state, and hence it will not remain with us permanently but will [at some time] go away from us.</b></p>

Since a state which comes at one time and goes away at another time is not the final state, no matter how glorious and blissful it may be, it will not be eternal.

<p id = "para-1889"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: This verse is adapted from the famous Vedic stanza, “<em>Purnamadah purnamidam</em> ...’, which was sometimes quoted by Sri Bhagavan. In some commentaries upon Sri Bhagavan’s teachings this Vedic stanza is wrongly interpreted to support the view that “it is both false and futile to affirm that <em>Brahman</em> alone is real and that the world [of names and forms] is unreal” (see <em>Sat-Darshana Bhashya</em>, 6th ed., pp. 6-7). However, when this stanza says, “That is whole and this is whole,” it should not be taken to mean that <em>Brahman</em> is real and that the world as such is also real. Sri Bhagavan’s teaching is that the whole world is unreal as world but real as <em>Brahman</em>, the whole (<em>purnam</em>), just as the snake is unreal as a snake but real as the rope, its base. Therefore this verse should be understood in the following light: “That [the rope] is the rope; this [the seeming snake] is also the rope. Even when this snake merges [disappears] into that rope, it is the rope.</p>
<p id = "para-1890">Even when this snake goes out [as if a snake] from that rope, the rope alone remains.” In other words, just as in truth the rope alone exists, so in truth <em>Brahman</em>, the whole, alone exists; and just as the seeming snake is a false appearance, so the seeming world is a false appearance. Neither the going out (manifestation) of this world-appearance nor its merging again into <em>Brahman</em> is real. <em>Brahman</em> ever remains as the immutable and unchanging whole.</p>

<p id = "para-1892"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: This verse explains the idea expressed in stanza 29 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>. We should know that in truth there is no attaining Liberation. Since bondage is a false mental conception, Liberation is also nothing but a false mental conception. Apart from Self, there is no <em>Jnani</em> and no <em>ajnani</em>; in the state of absolute truth, there is no <em>jnanopadesa</em> or <em>Mahavakya</em>! Even the thought that the natural state of Self has been lost is false; the <em>tapas</em> done to remove the miseries caused by that thought is also false; even the state of <em>Jnana</em> in which one has again attained abidance [through <em>tapas</em>] is false! The <em>upadesa</em> is that Self alone ever exists.</p>
<p id = "para-1893"><b>890. “Except the non-dual whole [Self], all the mundanemultiplicities imposed on It as ‘this’ or ‘that’ are not real even in the least; they are all nothing but a complete illusion superimposed on It” – such alone is the final verdict [of all <em>Jnanis</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-1894"><b>891. Since they [the <em>Jnanis</em>] say, “Though the One [seemingly] becomes the many [objects of this world], [in truth] It does not become anything”, and since from the very beginning everyone remains as that One [Self], the attainment of the true knowledge [that our natural state is thus ever-experienced or <em>nityaaparoksha</em>] is Liberation.</b></p>

This verse encourages such aspirants by pointing out that when the mind, which is the root-cause of all efforts, thus comes to a complete standstill due to utter weariness, that is exactly the moment when Self will shine forth clearly and without obstruction. The Tamil song <em>Konjam Poru</em> [which has been translated into English under the title ‘<em>Wait a Little</em>’ and printed as song No. 15 in ‘<em>A Selection of Songs from Sri Ramana Gitam</em>’] gives a graphic and encouraging description of the state of mind of an aspirant who reaches this state.</p>

<p id = "para-1899"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Many people are under the wrong impression that one who is in <em>nirvikalpa samadhi</em> should remain inert like an insentient log, knowing neither this body nor the world. After remaining for some time [either days, months or even years] in such a state, which is called <em>kashta nirvikalpa</em> or <em>kevala nirvikalpa samadhi</em>, one’s body-consciousness will return, whereupon the mind will become extroverted and all vices such as lust and anger will rise up due to past tendencies [<em>vasanas</em>]. This kind of <em>samadhi</em>, which is an experience that may occur during the early stages of practice of certain <em>sadhanas</em>, is only a temporary abeyance of mind [<em>manolaya</em>]. However, the right kind of <em>nirvikalpa samadhi</em> is only the annihilation of the mind [<em>mano-nasa</em>], the permanent destruction of the primal <em>vikalpa</em> ‘I am the body’. This is the state of true knowledge and is called <em>sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1900"><em>Kashta nirvikalpa samadhi</em> may be compared to the state of a pot tied with a rope that hangs under water in a well. Like the pot submerged in the water, the mind is submerged in <em>laya</em>. But at any time the pot can be drawn out by the rope. Likewise, since the mind is not destroyed, it can at any time be drawn out again by its <em>vasanas</em> and forced to wander under their sway. But in <em>sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi</em> the mind is dissolved in Self and loses its form or individuality, like a salt-doll immersed in the ocean. Therefore it cannot rise again. <em>Sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi</em>, in which the mind is destroyed, alone is the real <em>samadhi</em>.</p>

<p id = "para-1906"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The feeling ‘I am a man’ is a mere thought. It is the form of the ego. Consequently, if one begins to think or meditate ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’ or ‘I am Siva’ or ‘I am He’, that will also be a mere thought, another form of the same ego. Therefore, since this is only another kind of thought, one cannot thereby be freed from thoughts and attain the state of Self, whose form is mere existence [<em>Sat</em>]. Hence Sri Bhagavan warns that one who meditates ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’ will be cheated in the end.</p>

<p id = "para-1908"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: A wave is a wave so long as it moves; when that same wave settles down without moving, it is the ocean. Similarly, the mind is the mind so long as it moves and is limited; when the mind becomes still and unlimited, it is God or <em>Brahman</em>. The Tamil word <em>‘Kadavul’</em> [God] literally means <em>‘kadandu-ullavar’</em> [He who exists transcending]; hence our own real state, Self, which transcends all adjuncts such as ‘this’ or ‘that’, is God [<em>Kadavul</em>].</p>

<p id = "para-1910"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Refer to the second line of verse 5 of <em>Sri Arunachala Ashtakam</em>, in which Sri Bhagavan sings, “Just as a gem is polished, if the mind is polished on the stone called mind in order to free it of flaws, it will shine with the lustre of Thy Grace”. That is, only when the mind attends to itself will it be freed from flaws and thereby shine as the reality, the pure ‘I am’. By attending to second and third persons, the mind will only gather impurities. Therefore, by engaging in any activity or <em>sadhana</em> other than Self-attention, the mind will never die. It will die only when it attends to its own form in order to find out ‘What am I?’ or ‘Who am I?’ This truth was discovered by Sri Bhagavan from His own direct experience. Meditating upon or scrutinizing anything other than the mind is neither introversion [<em>antarmukham</em>] nor a means to know the reality. Only Self-attention – the practice of the mind’s attending to the first person singular feeling ‘I’ – will drown the mind in Self and thereby destroy it. This therefore is the only path to attain and abide as the reality.</p>

Meditating ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’, ‘I am He’ or ‘I am Siva’ is futile and is not at all a proper <em>jnana-sadhana</em>. According to Sri Bhagavan, the only true <em>jnana-sadhana</em> is to lose ‘I’, the ego, through the enquiry ‘Who am I?’</p>

<p id = "para-1919"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Verses 63, 64, 65 and 91 of this work are again to be referred to here. Some among us wrongly believe that though this universe undergoes innumerable changes such as creation, growth, decay and destruction, it is an ever-existing reality, and that all these changes are therefore true. Sri Bhagavan tells such people that their belief is wrong, and explains that the reason why they have such a wrong belief is only because of their wrong outlook of seeing the ever-unchanging Self as a universe having innumerable changes. Throughout this chapter Sri Bhagavan continues to refute their wrong belief with many arguments, and hence these verses serve as a proper condemnation of their wrong philosophy.</p>

Verily, Self is the Eye, the unlimited [and therefore changeless] Eye.” In other words, as is the eye, so is the sight. Therefore if, instead of seeing through the defective and changeful physical eyes, one sees through the unlimited and unchanging eye of Self, the universe will disappear and the one Self will be known to be existing all alone. When the truth is such, can there be any delusion more than that of seeing Self, the ever-unchanging reality, as this petty and changeful world? This is Sri Bhagavan’s question.</p>

Therefore be as you really are (i.e. abide in your true nature as Self).” It is also to be noted that in this verse Sri Bhagavan instructs the mind how to remain as an unattached witness to all these unreal <em>tattvas</em>. By imagining itself to be a witness to them, the mind can never remain truly unattached to them; only by the experience of the knowledge of the unattached Self (<em>asanga-swarupa-jnananubhava</em>), that is, only by knowing and being the real and ever-unattached Self, can one remain as an unattached witness to all the unreal <em>tattvas</em>.</p>

His state may be compared to a cinema screen, which is neither burnt by pictures of fire nor drenched by pictures of water, though it is the support of all those pictures. This completely unattached and unconcerned state of true knowledge (<em>jnana</em>) was well illustrated by the life of Sri Bhagavan. Though so many bad things went on around Him – though some bogus <em>sadhus</em> tried to pose as His guru, though because of jealousy they tried to kill Him by rolling boulders on Him, though some insincere devotees pretended to love Him but did mischief behind His back, though some people gave Him intoxicating drugs like <em>bhang</em>, though a will was made in His name, though court cases went on against Him, though an abusive book was written about Him, though some of His good devotees like Sri Muruganar were ill-treated and abused, though some so-called disciples even tried deliberately to misinterpret His teachings by mistranslating them and by writing false commentaries on them, and so on – and though so many good things went on around Him – though sincere devotees came to Him and praised Him as the Supreme Lord, though His Jayanti, Golden Jubilee and other functions were celebrated on such a grand scale, though His name and fame spread all over the world, and so on – He ever remained as a mere witness, unconcerned with all these things.</p>

<p id = "para-1956"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Vali had a boon whereby he gained half of the strength of any opponent who faced him, and therefore Ram had to kill him without confronting him face to face. Likewise, if one tries to kill the <em>mind-maya</em> by confronting it directly [that is, by struggling to control the thoughts, the rising and jumping nature of the mind], one will in fact be giving fresh strength to it. Since the mind [i.e. the rising and jumping nature of the mind] is an object known to us, we should treat it as a second person and ignore it by turning our attention towards the first person, the mere feeling ‘I’. The mind will then lose the power of Grace [<em>anugraha-sakti</em>] and thus it will gradually subside and die of its own accord.

However, this interpretation is wrong, because unless one knows the true nature of Self, it is impossible to look upon all things as Self. Trying to imagine that everything is Self would only be a mental <em>bhavana</em>, and hence it would not be an effective means to make the restless nature of the mind subside.

<p id = "para-1965"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Here Sri Bhagavan asserts that even after the annihilation of the first thought which was shining all this time as ‘I am this body’, there does exist a Self shining as <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, ‘I am I’. Some schools of Buddhism say, “Finally there will remain nothing as Self; only a void [<em>sunya</em>] will be there”. But Sri Bhagavan refutes this wrong belief and emphatically declares from His own experience, “There certainly does exist a reality [<em>sat-vastu</em>], which is <em>Jnanananda</em>; that state is not a void [<em>sunya</em>] but a perfect whole [<em>purna</em>]”. Compare here verse 20 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>, “Where ‘I’ [the ego-self] dies, that One [the real Self] shines forth spontaneously as ‘I-I’; that alone is the whole [<em>purna</em>],” and verse 12 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “Self is true knowledge; it is not a void [though devoid of all objective knowledge]”.</p>

<p id = "para-1970"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The ability to know all other things such as the happenings in the past, present and future, and the ability to master all the sixty-four arts, are glorified by people as ‘Omniscience’ or <em>‘sarvajnatvam’</em>. However, since Sri Bhagavan says in verse 13 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “Knowledge of multiplicity is ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>],” and since He says in verse 26 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “Verily the ego is all,” all these things which are glorified as ‘omniscience’ should in fact be understood to be mere objective knowledge of the ego, and hence to be nothing but ignorance. In verse 13 of _Ulladu Narpad_u Sri Bhagavan says, “That which knows [multiplicity or otherness] cannot be true knowledge,” because in truth no other thing exists to know or to make known. Therefore the non-dual Self-knowledge which shines by itself as the whole [<em>purna</em>] without knowing any other thing, alone is true omniscience or <em>sarvajnatvam</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-1971"><b>927.

<p id = "para-1972"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: An aspirant whose mind has not subsided will already be confused by all the objective knowledge he has gathered and will thereby be suffocating, being unable to bear the heavy burden of his wavering thoughts. Therefore, if he is able to acquire more knowledge, such as knowledge of all the events happening in all times and all places, will he not be still more confused and will he not be burdened with still more waves of thoughts? Hence, will it not be impossible for him to relieve himself from all thoughts and to abide peacefully in Self? Therefore, such so-called omniscience [the knowledge of all alien objects] is not only useless by also very harmful.</p>
<p id = "para-1973"><b>928.

<p id = "para-1974"><b>929. Only when one is deluded [into thinking] that one isthe knower [the mind], one feels ‘I am one of little knowledge’. But when the true knowledge dawns, omniscience will also perish completely like the little knowledge.</b></p>

Therefore, just like the little knowledge, the various kinds of omniscience must also be destroyed at that time. Thus in the supreme state of Self-knowledge, nothing will remain except the sole real knowledge, the first person singular feeling ‘I am’.</p>
<p id = "para-1976"><b>930. The <em>Vedas</em> glorify God as ‘omniscient’ only for the sake of those who think themselves to be people of little knowledge.

<p id = "para-1978"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: People have many wrong conceptions about the state of a <em>Jnani</em> or <em>Jivanmukta</em>, and one such misconception is refuted here. “What people see as water, the <em>Jivanmukta</em> also sees as water, and what they see as food, He also sees as food. Therefore, in His experience of sense-objects, the <em>Jivanmukta</em> is the same as other people. But even while the <em>Jivanmukta</em> thus sees these differences, He sees the non-difference in them” – are there not many <em>pandits</em> and lecturers who talk and write thus, even though they themselves have no experience of <em>Advaita</em> but have only read about it in books? But who is the proper authority to say what is the actual experience of a <em>Jivanmukta</em>? Only a real <em>Jivanmukta</em>! Thus Bhagavan Sri Ramana, who has actually experienced the reality and who is the true Loka Maha Guru, declares in this verse that such statements are wrong, and in the next verse He explains how and why they are wrong.

So long as one sees oneself as an individual who sees the world of differences, one cannot but see the <em>Jnani</em> likewise as an individual who sees differences [see <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> verse 4, “Can the sight be otherwise than the eye?”] But since the <em>jnani</em> is in fact nothing but the bodiless and individuality-less <em>Jnana</em> Itself, to see Him as a seer and to believe that even He is seeing differences like oneself, is true only in the outlook of <em>ajnanis</em>. The absolute truth, however, is that the <em>Jnani</em> is not a seer and that He never sees any differences, for as Sri Bhagavan says in verse 13 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “Knowledge of multiplicity is only ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>]”.</p>
<p id = "para-1981">Thus in the above two verses Sri Bhagavan clearly refutes the wrong idea expressed in the note at the end of the introduction [<em>bhoomika</em>] to <em>Sat-Darshana-Bhashya</em>, 6th ed. pp. 35 to 38, namely the idea that a <em>Jnani</em> or liberated soul retains His individuality in spite of the destruction of the ego, and that He “perceives diversity in unity and experiences unity in diversity” [compare here pp. 160 to 164 of <em>Maha Yoga</em>, 7th ed.]. Regarding this erroneous theory of <em>bheda-abheda</em> or unity in diversity, Sri Bhagavan used to say that if the least difference or diversity is perceived, it means that the ego or individuality is there, so if difference is experienced, non-difference or unity would merely be a theoretical proposition and not an actual experience [see <em>The Golden Jubilee Souvenir</em>, 2nd ed., p. 295, and <em>The Mountain Path</em>, October 1981, p. 224].</p>

In order to point out that their way of thinking is wrong and their aim is sheer foolishness, Sri Bhagavan begins this verse with the words “Because of one’s wrong outlook,” thereby implying as follows: “It is only because of your wrong outlook that this world appears to you in such a way; God never created it thus; the wrongs you see in the world are a result of <em>drishti-dosha</em> [a defect in your outlook] and not of <em>srishti-dosha</em> [a defect in God’s creation]”. Therefore Sri Bhagavan teaches that true omniscience or <em>sarvajnatvam</em> is only the removal of one’s wrong outlook [<em>dosha-drishti</em>] through the attainment of <em>Jnanadrishti</em> [the outlook of <em>Jnana</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-1985"><b>935. If all one’s mental images [that appear] in dream werenot [already] dwelling within [one], they could not be seen.

<p id = "para-1986"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: All that one sees in dream is only a projection of the <em>vasanas</em> already dwelling within one. Likewise, all that one sees even in this waking state is only a projection of one’s own <em>vasanas</em> (see verse 84). Therefore, in order to know all, one need only know oneself. However, since oneself (the Self) alone truly exists and since the so-called ‘all’ is truly non-existent and unreal, there will be no ‘all’ to be known when oneself is known. As Sri Bhagavan says in the second line of the third verse of <em>Atmavidya Kirtanam</em>, “What [else] is there to know after oneself is known?”</p>

Since only the three states of waking, dream and sleep are under the experience of all people, the state of <em>Jnana</em> or wakeful sleep [<em>jagratsushupti</em>], which is none of these three states, is called the ‘fourth’ by <em>sastras</em>. But Sri Bhagavan asks here, “Why should this state be called the fourth or <em>turiya</em> when, at the time of experience of this state, which is the eternal state of Self-awakening, the other three states [waking, dream and sleep] are found to be truly non-existent?” Then should not this state be considered as the very first? No, it would be wrong even to consider it as the first, because no second state will exist to be experienced after this state, the only real state, is experienced. Therefore, instead of calling it either as the first or as the fourth, it should really be called only ‘<em>atita</em>’ [the all-transcending state, <em>turiyatita</em>] – such is the <em>upadesa</em> given in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-1997">Even the <em>jiva’s</em> three states of waking, dream and sleep, are not really three; they are only two, namely <em>sakala</em> [the state of functioning of the mind] and <em>kevala</em> [the state of non-functioning of the mind]. Even these two have only relative reality [<em>vyavakarika satya</em>]. In truth, sleep alone is the nature of <em>turiya</em> or <em>turiyatita</em>. For a fuller explanation of this point, read pages 144 to 145 of <em>The Path of Sri Ramana</em> – Part One, 2nd ed.

<p id = "para-2002"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In order to suit the poor power of understanding of immature minds, many unfitting terms are used in the scriptures. Sri Bhagavan sometimes used to point out how inapt are some such scriptural terms, including the term <em>‘Akhandakara-vritti’</em>, which literally means ‘movement [<em>vritti</em>] in an unfragmented or unbroken form’. This term is sometimes used to denote the final state of perfect Self-abidance, and is also sometimes used to denote certain practices such as meditation upon the <em>Mahavakya</em> ‘I am <em>Brahman</em>’. However, Sri Bhagavan reveals in this verse that this term is fitting neither to the state of practice nor to the state of attainment, for the state of practice is a state of <em>khanda</em> [fragmentation], while the state of attainment is a state of <em>nivritti</em>. In the supreme state of <em>Akhanda</em> [non-fragmentation], there can be no room for any movement or <em>vritti</em>. When a river merges in the ocean, it loses its separate identity or individuality as a river and becomes one with the ocean; therefore it would be unfitting to call it a ‘river in the form of an ocean’ [<em>samudrakara-nadi</em>]. Likewise, when all <em>vrittis</em> [movements of the mind] including the first <em>vritti</em>, the <em>aham-vritti</em> or ‘I’-thought, have merged into the unbroken state of Self-knowledge, they lose their separate identity as <em>vrittis</em> and become one with that unbroken state; therefore, instead of calling that unbroken state as mere <em>‘Akhanda’</em>, it is unfitting to try to retain the term <em>‘vritti’</em> and to call that state a <em>‘vritti</em> in an unbroken form’ [<em>akhandakara-vritti</em>].</p>

That which really exists is only bliss, our real nature. In the past, present and future there never has been and there never will be such thing as ‘misery’ at all. The dyad ‘pleasure and pain’ is an illusion or imagination which seems to exist only because of the defective outlook of the ego, the rising of which is itself unreal. Therefore misery can only be as real as the ego. Since the ego or <em>jiva</em> is a false appearance which has no real existence, the miseries which appear in the defective outlook of the ego are also a false appearance, like the appearance of the blue colour seen in the colourless sky.</p>

Likewise, when one wakes up from the sleep of Self-forgetfulness, in which the dream of one’s present life is occurring, one will realize that all the miseries that one experienced as a <em>jiva</em> are in truth unreal and non-existent [see verse 1 of <em>Ekatma Panchakam</em>]. Refer also to the example given by Sri Bhagavan in verse 30 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em>, “... though lying motionless here [on his bed], [a man in dream] climbs up a hill and falls into a precipice”. The teaching of Sri Bhagavan is that misery is unreal, being merely mental.</p>
<p id = "para-2031">Throughout this chapter Sri Bhagavan expounds the truth that misery is non-existent in order to strengthen the <em>titiksha</em> [the forbearance or ability to endure misery] in aspirants, lest they should become disheartened and give up their <em>sadhana</em> on account of the various miseries which occur in their life.</p>

<p id = "para-2038"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The words ‘sleep in the present waking state’ [a_navum nanavil sushupti_] denote the state of wakeful sleep [<em>jagrat-sushupti</em>] or <em>turiya</em>, the state of experiencing no differences during waking. In order to attain this state, aspirants have to make efforts in the waking state. However, some aspirants used to ask Sri Bhagavan, “Do we also have to make such efforts in dream, so that we may attain the state of experiencing no differences even during dream?” This doubt is answered by Sri Bhagavan in this verse.</p>
<p id = "para-2039">The feeling ‘I am this body’ [<em>dehatma-buddhi</em>] rises in the subtle body during dream only because of the habit of identifying the gross body as ‘I’ during waking. Hence, if one practices Self-enquiry in the waking state and thereby eradicates the <em>dehatma-buddhi</em> [the habit of thus identifying a body as ‘I’] in this state, that itself will be sufficient to eradicate the <em>dehatma-buddhi</em> in dream also. Therefore Sri Bhagavan advises in the next verse that, until the <em>dehatma-buddhi</em> is completely eradicated even in dream, one should not give up Self-enquiry in the waking state. Refer here to the fourth paragraph of the first chapter of <em>Vichara Sangraham</em> where Sri Bhagavan says, “All the three bodies [gross, subtle and causal] consisting of the five sheaths are included in the feeling ‘I am the body’. If that one [i.e. the identification with the gross body] is removed, all [i.e. the identification with the other two bodies] will automatically be removed. Since [the identification with] the other bodies [the subtle and causal] survive only by depending upon this [the identification with the gross body], there is no need to remove them one by one.”</p>
<p id = "para-2040">The words <em>‘kanavil sushupti’</em> [sleep in dream], which are used in the first and last lines of this verse, may also be taken to mean ‘sleep without dream’, in which case the following alternative meaning can be given: “Do not be disheartened and lose your mental vigour thinking that sleep without dream has not yet been obtained. If the strength of [experiencing] sleep in the present waking state is obtained, then sleep without dream will also be obtained.”</p>

<p id = "para-2047"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: ‘The sleep in which there is no loss of consciousness’ [<em>arivu-azhiya tukkam</em>] means only the state of Self-knowledge. Here consciousness [<em>arivu</em>] means <em>prajna</em> or the knowledge of one’s own existence, and not the knowledge of other things. That which knows other things is not true knowledge [see <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> verse 12]. The state we call sleep is the state in which we know no other things, not even the body. The state we call waking is the state in which, along with the knowledge of one’s own existence [‘I am’], there is also knowledge of other things. The state in which we remain conscious merely of our own existence, like in waking, but in which the mind [the knower of other things] does not rise, like in sleep, is called the state of conscious sleep or wakeful sleep.

In order to make the ego die, the practice of <em>‘Sivaya Namah’</em> [complete obeisance to Lord Siva, the Supreme Reality] is necessary. And in order to make the ego do obeisance [i.e. surrender itself] to Lord Siva, one must attend to its source and thereby prevent it from rising [see <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> verse 27, “The state in which ‘I’ does not rise, is the state ‘We are That’. Unless one scrutinizes the source whence ‘I’ rises, how to attain the state of egolessness, in which ‘I’ does not rise?...”].

If a religion is a true one, at least one sacred utterance of <em>Mahavakya</em> which reveals the transcendent nature of Self, should be found in its scriptures. If such a <em>Mahavakya</em> were not found in its scriptures, it would not be a true religion. For example, Sri Bhagavan used to point out the peerless <em>Mahavakya</em> ‘I am that I am’ which is revealed in the Holy Bible. In the same manner, He also used to point out the sacred utterance <em>‘Ana’l-Haq’</em> in the Islamic Religion <em>al-Haq</em> is one of the 99 names of Allah, and means ‘the reality’ or ‘the truth’; “<em>Ana’l-Haq</em>” means ‘I am the reality’, and is a sacred utterance made by Hallaj, a famous Sufi Sage].

Even if by one’s own strength one is able to conquer and subdue all one’s powerful enemies, one cannot be said to possess real heroism, for one tries to conquer them only because of the fear that they may do harm to one. Fear is the sole cause which impels one to conquer one’s enemies, and knowledge of duality is the sole cause for fear.

Since the heart [<em>hridayam</em>] is called <em>‘ullam’</em> in Tamil because it is the place where that [Self] thus exists and shines, this word <em>‘ullam’</em> is used here with a double meaning [namely ‘am’ and ‘heart’], and hence both meanings can be taken here.</p>

<p id = "para-2071"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The Tamil word <em>‘kan’</em>, which means ‘eye’, is also sometimes used to mean ‘true knowledge’ or <em>‘jnana’</em>. Therefore the words ‘the eye that surges as everything’ [<em>ellamay pongum kan</em>] also mean the knowledge ‘I am’ which shines as everything.

Similarly, if we are to accuse God of not bestowing His gracious glance upon us, can we not do so only after we have turned within and looked at Him, the Self-consciousness which shines within us as ‘I am’? Therefore, when we never attend to Self but always remain extroverted, we cannot justly accuse God of not bestowing His Grace upon us. “Turning inwards, daily see yourself with an introverted look and it will be known [that He is ever bestowing His Grace] ... ,” sings Sri Bhagavan in verse 44 of <em>Sri Arunachala Aksharamanamalai</em>.

<p id = "para-2078"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Knowing [<em>chit</em>] oneself to be the reality [<em>sat</em>] is bliss [<em>ananda</em>].

It is only because of this wrong knowledge that such a thing as ‘misery’ appears to come into existence. However, when one knows oneself to be Self [atman], since the <em>chittam</em> then loses its nature of movement and attains the nature of consciousness [<em>chit-rupa</em>], it knows itself to be the reality [<em>sat</em>]. Since this union of <em>sat</em> and <em>chit</em> is the fullness of <em>ananda</em>, misery will be known to be ever non-existent and the truth that Self alone is <em>sat</em>, <em>chit</em> and <em>ananda</em> will shine forth. The state of supreme bliss [<em>paramananda</em>] which is experienced when the power of consciousness [<em>chit-sakti</em>] and the Lord [Siva] whose nature is existence [<em>sat</em>] thus become one, is the true significance of the form of Ardhanariswara [the Lord who is both Siva and Sakti].</p>

Since there can be no existence other than this consciousness, this consciousness [<em>chit</em>] itself remains as the single mere existence [<em>sat</em>], which is Self. Since that state is a state of non-duality, the bliss experience there is also nothing but Self itself.

<p id = "para-2081"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: The death of the insentient ego is the severing of the <em>chit-jada-granthi</em> [the knot between consciousness and the insentient body]. Severing the <em>chit-jada-granthi</em> means separating through Self-enquiry the body and Self, which were joined together through ignorance [<em>avidya</em>]. “The Lord of the Mount danced and [thereby] separated the body and Self,” sings Sri Sundaramurti Nayanar. Here [in the present verse], the fruit of the severance of the knot [<em>granthi-bheda</em>] is described as “the bliss [which is] Self alone” [<em>tan-mattira-inbam</em>], and the nature of consciousness, which results from that [the severance of the knot], is described as “existence alone” [<em>sat-mattiram</em>].</p>

We should know that being conscious [<em>chit</em>] of our own existence [<em>sat</em>] is itself bliss [<em>ananda</em>]. Verse 979 should be referred to here. The love for oneself shines in all <em>jivas</em> because self-love is the very nature of Self. Therefore, since love is the nature of Self, and since Self is the very form of supreme happiness, it is wrong to regard happiness as being the result of love; instead of thus regarding love and happiness as being cause and effect, we should understand that love is itself happiness. Since by loving Self one knows Self and by knowing Self one loves Self, we should also understand that love is itself happiness. Since by loving Self one knows Self and by knowing Self one loves Self, we should also understand that knowledge itself is love, which is happiness. Since Self is one’s own existence or being, it can never become an object to be known, and hence knowing Self is nothing but being Self; thus we should understand that being [<em>Sat</em>] itself is knowledge [<em>Chit</em>], which is both happiness [<em>ananda</em>] and love [<em>priyam</em>].

The secret behind all this is revealed in these verses.</p>
<p id = "para-2090">The body is impermanent [and hence unreal or <em>asat</em>], insentient [<em>jada</em>] and the source of all miseries such as disease and so on, whereas the consciousness ‘I’ is the shining of <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>. The wrong knowledge which identifies this body as ‘I’ is the ego. It is only during the time of the ego’s functioning and only in the outlook of the ego, which thus mistakes the unreal, insentient and miserable body as being real, sentient and a source of happiness [that is, as being <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>], that this world appears to be real [<em>sat</em>], the living beings in it appear to be sentient [<em>chit</em>] and the objects in it appear to be a source of happiness [<em>ananda</em>]. These three verses thus clearly assert that the ego is the sole cause which makes the names and forms [<em>nama-rupa</em>, the two unreal aspects of <em>Brahman</em>] appear as if they were real, sentient and a source of happiness [<em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, the three real aspects of <em>Brahman</em>]. To impose existence [<em>sat</em>], consciousness [<em>chit</em>] and happiness [<em>ananda</em>], which are real, upon the names and forms, which are unreal, and thereby to see those names and forms as real, is the wrong outlook [<em>dosha-drishti</em>] of the ego. When this ego is destroyed through Self-enquiry, the apparent <em>sat-chit-ananda</em> imposed upon the world will disappear, and the real <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, which is Self, the base or support of the world-appearance, alone will shine. Only when the ego is thus destroyed, will the truth be known that it was only because of the existence [<em>sat</em>] of Self that the names and forms of the world appeared as if they were really having existence, that it was only because of the consciousness [<em>chit</em>] of Self that the names and forms of the world appeared as if they were really having consciousness, and that it was only became of the happiness [<em>ananda</em>] of Self that the names and forms of the world appeared as if they were really giving happiness.</p>
<p id = "para-2091">Not only do these verses reveal this profound truth, but they do so in a very beautiful manner. The first and last words of each verse denote respectively <em>sat</em>, <em>chit</em> and <em>ananda</em>. In the first verse the ego is described as being unreal, defective and fleshy [in contrast to reality or <em>sat</em>], in the second verse it is described as being insentient, deluded and mad [in contrast to consciousness or <em>Chit</em>], and in the third verse it is described as being miserable, proud and devoid of happiness [in contrast to bliss or <em>ananda</em>]. Many other points of literary and linguistic beauty can be pointed out in these three verses, all of which help to emphasise the profound truth revealed in them.</p>
<p id = "para-2092"><b>978. Those who say, “If they abide as the supreme reality,the form of bliss [<em>sukha-swarupa</em>], for them there can be no experience of bliss,” are those who [thereby] argue and assert that the form of bliss [i.e. the supreme reality, which is <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>] is merely an insentient object like sugar.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2093"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In the intoxication of dualistic devotion some people used to say, “I do not like to become sugar itself; I prefer to remain like an ant sitting by the side of the sugar to taste its sweetness”. That is to say, there is a wrong belief among some devotees that the state of non-duality [<em>advaita</em>] in which one merges in and becomes one with <em>Brahman</em> will be a dry and empty state devoid of bliss [<em>ananda</em>]. Only those who have not achieved the experience of perfect devotion [<em>sampurna-bhakti</em>] can believe or speak like this. Refer to page 152 of <em>The Path of Sri Ramana</em> – Part Two, where it is explained that the perfect devotee [<em>sampurnabhaktiman</em>] is only he who has ‘otherless love’ [<em>ananya-priti</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-2094">Sugar is an insentient object [<em>jada-vastu</em>], while an ant is sentient and is thereby able to enjoy the sweetness of sugar. But <em>Brahman</em> is not like this; It is not an insentient object like sugar. <em>Brahman</em>, which is the reality [<em>sat</em>], is also consciousness [<em>chit</em>] and is thereby able to know itself. Since <em>Brahman</em> is also bliss [<em>ananda</em>], which is the very nature of consciousness [<em>chit-swabhava</em>], no other sentient object [<em>chit-vastu</em>] is needed to experience the bliss of <em>Brahman</em>. Therefore it is foolish to compare Self, which is not only bliss but also the consciousness which knows bliss, to an insentient object like sugar.</p>
<p id = "para-2095">It is completely wrong to say, as some people do, that this comparison was taught by Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna, who had the perfect experience of <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, would never have thus compared <em>Brahman</em> to an insentient object like sugar.

However, since the purpose of all spoken words such as <em>stotras</em> sung by the devotee or <em>upadesa</em> given by the Guru is only to destroy the ego and thereby to make the difference ‘I’ and ‘He’ merge into oneness in the state of supreme Silence, in that final state spoken words will be no further use.</p>
<p id = "para-2141">Since the Tamil word for ’eye’ [<em>kan</em>] also means knowledge or consciousness, the phrase “When the look of eye meets together with eye” should here be understood to mean when the attention of the limited individual consciousness [the ego] meets with and thereby merges into the unlimited supreme consciousness [Self], just like a river meeting with and merging into the ocean.

<p id = "para-2147">Moreover, in the state of absolute reality which is experienced by <em>Jnanis</em>, the state of <em>ajnana</em> is realized to be ever non-existent, and hence it is impossible for them to think of a method by which they passed from the ever-non-existent state of <em>ajnana</em> to the state of <em>Jnana</em>, the ever-existing and sole reality. That is why it is said in verse 413 of this work that it is impossible to trace the path by which <em>Jnanis</em> have reached Self. Since Self alone exists, there can be no place or state (such as <em>ajnana</em>) outside Self from which it can be reached and hence no path by which it can be reached. For a bird which is flying in the sky, there can be no path to reach the sky, and for a fish which is swimming in the water, there can be no path to reach the water. Since we are truly ever Self and Self alone, there can be no path or method for us to reach Self. However, so long as we think that we do not know ourselves to be Self, the sole existing reality, Sages have to advise us to try to find out who or what we really are. When we thus turn our attention towards ourselves in order to find out ‘Who am I?’, we will find that we are always nothing but Self alone, and that the seeming ego or individuality which we are wrongly taking to be ‘I’ was ever non-existent. In that state we cannot think that we have followed any path or method; we will merely realize that we are ever as we are, and that we have never undergone even the least change or movement of any kind.</p>

<p id = "para-2162"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The <em>upadesa</em> given by Sri Bhagavan in this verse is the same as that given by Sanatkumara in the <em>Chandoyga Upanishad</em>, 7.24.1, namely, “That [state] in which one does not see what-is-other [<em>anya</em>], does not hear what-is-other and does not know what-is-other, is the Infinite [<em>bhuma</em>], whereas that [state] in which one sees what-is-other, hears what-is-other and knows what-is-other, is finite [<em>alpa</em>].

In the same <em>Upanishad</em> 7.25.1 and 7.25.2, the Infinite [<em>bhuma</em>] is identified as being synonymous first with ‘I’ (<em>aham</em>) and then with Self (<em>atma</em>). Therefore in this verse and the next, the word ‘<em>Bhuma</em>’ should be understood to mean Self or <em>Brahman</em>, our own true state of mere being.</p>
<p id = "para-2163">From the present verse we have to understand that any state in which there is even the least knowledge of any second- or third-person object is not the true state of Self, the real waking; it is only another dream occurring in the sleep of Self-forgetfulness (refer here to <em>The Path of Sri Ramana</em> – Part One, p. 143). Therefore, whatever state we may experience, even if it be a divine or heavenly state such as living in <em>Siva Loka</em> or <em>Vaikuntha</em>, so long as we experience anything other than the mere Self-consciousness ‘I am’, we should enquire ‘Who knows these other things?’ and thereby turn our attention back towards the first person feeling ‘I’. When the attention is thus fixed more and more intensely upon the first person, the rising of that first person (the ego or mind which sees those other things) will subside more and more, until finally it merges forever in its source, whereupon the true state of Self, in which nothing other than the mere Self-consciousness ‘I am’ is known, will be experienced.</p>

In the finite [<em>alpa</em>] there is no happiness. The infinite alone is happiness [<em>bhumaiva sukham</em>] ....” But in the present verse Sri Bhagavan reveals more about the nature of that <em>Bhuma</em>, which alone is happiness, namely that it is the non-dual <em>Jnana</em> which is devoid of anything seen or anything heard, and which is devoid even of the ego, whose nature is pramada (inattentiveness to Self) and whose so-called ‘greatness’ lies only in knowing finite objects. From the two verses in this chapter we should understand that true happiness lies only in the infinite, eternal and real state of non-dual knowledge, which is devoid of both the knowing mind and the objects known, and that not even the least real happiness exists in the finite, transitory and unreal state of dual knowledge, in which objects are known.</p>

<p id = "para-2175"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The <em>jiva</em>, the reflection of consciousness, is here described as unlimited because it is the root-cause of an unlimited quantity of tendencies (<em>vasanas</em>), the seeds which give rise to all ignorant imaginations (<em>ajnana-kalpanas</em>).

In this simile, the dry wood of the vast forest is to be understood as being like the innumerable <em>vasanas</em> of the <em>jiva</em>, which have become dry as a result of the <em>jiva’s vairagya</em> or inattention to them, and which have thereby become fit fuel for the fire of <em>Jnana</em> (see pages 102 to 103 of <em>The Path of Sri Ramana – Part One</em>). The Light of pure consciousness, which is here said to be like a wild forest fire that spreads all around and instantly consumes the ego and all its products (the whole world-appearance), is the same as the blazing sun of Arunachala (the sun of Self-knowledge) which, as described in verse 27 of <em>Sri Arunachala Aksharamanamalai</em> and verse 1 of <em>Sri Arunachala Pancharatna</em>, swallows everything by its spreading rays of bright light (see verse 114 of this work).</p>

<p id = "para-2177"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Desire is the sole cause of misery, and it can arise only if something other than oneself exists.

<p id = "para-2181"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In a sentence the object depends upon the predicate or main verb, and the predicate depends upon the subject. Without the predicate and object, the subject can stand, but without the subject, the predicate and object cannot stand. In this verse the entire world-appearance, which consists merely of the knowledge acquired through the five senses, is compared to the object of a sentence; <em>Parasakti</em>, the power of <em>maya</em> which creates this worldappearance, is compared to the predicate or main verb of a sentence; and the empty space of <em>Jnana</em>, the true state of Self upon which both <em>Parasakti</em> and Her creation depend for their seeming existence, is compared to the subject of a sentence. Thus in a humorous way Sri Bhagavan declares that this whole vast universe and its powerful creator exist only by depending upon a mere open and empty space.</p>
<p id = "para-2182">Another hidden meaning is also given in this verse. The Tamil word for ‘subject’ is <em>‘ezhuvay’</em>, which can also mean ‘the rising place’; the Tamil word for ‘predicate’ is <em>‘payanilay’</em>, which can also mean ‘useless’; and the Tamil word for ‘object’ is ‘<em>seyyappadu porul’</em>, which means ‘the thing made’. Thus Sri Bhagavan indirectly warns, “If you rise from the space of <em>Jnana</em> and thereby create so many things, it is of no use”.</p>
<p id = "para-2183">Throughout this present chapter, from verse 1007 to 1015, the state of <em>Jnana</em> – the supreme goal of life [<em>parama-purushartha</em>] which is finally to be attained by <em>sadhakas</em> after practising so many <em>sadhanas</em> and after making so many sacrifices throughout so many births – instead of being glorified as a very great achievement, is described as “an open and empty space, a mere space which is devoid of any other thing to be desired or attained, a mere state of absolute silence”. However, it should be understood that the reason why Sri Bhagavan seemingly ridicules the state of <em>Jnana</em> in this manner is only to enable us to know the real greatness of that empty space-like state. That is, Sri Bhagavan teaches in these verses that, since not only all the countless objects of this unimaginable great and vast universe, but even the <em>parasakti</em> which creates and sustains them, rise and spread out only from the space of Self-knowledge [<em>atma-jnanakasa</em>], which is the mere consciousness ‘I am’, the supreme and unsurpassed state is only the state of <em>Jnana</em>, the mere knowledge of our own existence, which is the base that supports that almighty <em>Parasakti</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2184">Since, having risen from and forsaken the state of mere existence-consciousness [the knowledge of their own being], the minds of all <em>jivas</em> always remain extroverted and take pride only in objective knowledge, they will not be fit to attain the state of <em>moksha</em> or <em>Jnana</em> unless they give up that liking for objective knowledge and instead gain great love for and find complete satisfaction in the state of mere being. It is only in order to teach this truth and thereby to instill firm <em>vairagya</em> in the hearts of His devotees, that Sri Bhagavan glorifies the state of <em>Jnana</em> by describing it in this chapter as a mere open and empty space. It is also only for this same reason that Sri Bhagavan once humorously remarked, “Everyone who comes here says that they have come only for <em>moksha</em>. But if even a small experience of <em>moksha</em> were given as a sample, that would be sufficient, and not even a single crow or sparrow would remain here; all would fly away and I would be left sitting here all alone!”</p>

<p id = "para-2198">Truly, no <em>jiva</em> can ever realize Self; it is Self alone that realizes itself [refer to pages 105 to 106 of <em>The Path of Sri Ramana – Part One</em>]. Moreover, from the words used in verse 1021, “at the time, which is in the form of Self, and in the place, which is the form of Self”, we should understand that Self does not realize itself at any particular time or in any particular place. Since time and space are both unreal, being nothing but a false appearance in the real Self, the experience of a <em>Jnani</em> is that He, the Self, has ever known Himself at all times and in all places. For Him ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>] is something which is ever non-existent, so though in the outlook of others it may appear as if He has attained <em>jnana</em> at a particular time and place, in His own outlook He does not truly feel that He was once in ignorance and has now attained <em>Jnana</em> [see verse 1085].</p>

<p id = "para-2202"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em> and <em>Michael James</em></b>: The very nature of the ego is to attend only to things other than itself. Therefore, the ego does not know who or what it is. This ignorance of its own nature (i.e. the ignorance of the fact that it truly has no existence of its own) is what is meant here by the words “the ego which hides itself” (<em>olikkum</em> ahankaram). But if this transient and unreal ego, which rises in the form of the wrong knowledge ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’, tries to turn its attention away from the world of second and third persons, which it projects through the five senses, and towards itself, the first person, in order to find out ‘Who am I?’, it will subside into its source, the heart or Self, whereupon the eternal and real state will shine forth of its own accord in the form of the true knowledge ‘I am I’.</p>
<p id = "para-2203"><b>1023.</b> <b>If – instead of whirling with longing [for worldly pleasures] because of objectively knowing other things which appear in front of it due to [its] objective attention – the wicked mind attends to itself, enquiring ‘Who am I who knows objects?’, [it will attain that state of] abidance in its own reality which alone is the true state [of Self].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2204"><b>1024.</b> <b>Whichever <em>asrama</em> they have entered and whichever caste [<em>varna</em>] they have been born into, <em>Jnanis</em> will ever remain in their own state [the natural state of Self].

<p id = "para-2205"><b>1025.</b> <b>The state of Self alone is the real and lovable state.On the other hand, all the states of living in heaven, [which is] like a sky-lotus, are only unreal mental states which feed more and more upon delusion and which, like the water of a mirage, appear [only] due to imagination.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2206"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The words ‘like a sky-lotus’ [<em>van-murali pol</em>] can give two meanings, namely (i) ‘[heavens] such as <em>Brahma-Loka</em>’ [because the throne of Brahma, whose abode is in the sky, is a lotus], and (ii) ‘like an imaginary lotus in the sky’. Just like the imaginary lotus seen in the sky and like the imaginary water seen in a mirage, all states other than the state of Self are mere mental delusions and are truly non-existent. Even the pleasures of living in the various kinds of heavens such as <em>Brahma Loka</em> are trivial and unreal, and hence they cannot satisfy our yearning for complete and perfect happiness any more than the water of a mirage can quench our thirst. Therefore, the only state which is truly worthy to be loved and aspired for is the state of Self.</p>
<p id = "para-2207"><b>1026.</b> <b>Even though one’s own natural reality itself exists[and is experienced daily in deep sleep] as the supreme happiness, [one’s] searching for happiness and [thereby] suffering with the deluded and deceptive mind always going after what-is-other [the nonSelf], is itself losing that which is happiness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2208"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since the actual truth of their own experience is expressed by everyone thus, “I woke up from sleep; I slept happily,” it is agreed by everyone that Self shines as the form of happiness in the natural state of sleep, where the mind is empty and devoid of attachment to sense-objects. If it is asked why that happiness, which existed as one’s own nature in that state, ceases to be experienced as soon as sleep comes to an end, it is because of one’s desire to run after sense-objects, having been separated from one’s own state. Therefore it is advised that one should attain the unsurpassed happiness which is one’s own true experience, by keeping the mind unshaken by the desire for sense-objects, which arises due to delusion, by knowing oneself and by shining without inattention [<em>pramada</em>], remaining peaceful even in the waking state as in sleep.</p>
<p id = "para-2209"><b>1027.</b> <b><em>Jnanis</em> know that the taste of Self [<em>atma-rasam</em>] alone is the best taste [<em>ati-rasam</em>], and hence they abide in the state of Self.

<p id = "para-2210"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: In the appendix of <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai – Urai</em>, Sri Sadhu Om included eleven stray verses of Sri Bhagavan and gave notes indicating where each one should be incorporated in the text. In verse 6 of that appendix, which should be incorporated here, Sri Bhagavan says:</p>
<p id = "para-2211"><b>If [through the enquiry ‘Who am I?’] one knows one’s true nature in the heart, [it will be found to be] existence-consciousness-bliss [<em>sat-chit-ananda</em>], which is beginningless and endless fullness [wholeness or perfection].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2212">In the above verse Sri Bhagavan has paraphrased verse 28 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2213"><b>1028.</b> <b>Those who do not know that their own nature is happiness, will be deluded like a musk-deer, [whereas] those who clearly know their own nature [to be existence-consciousness-bliss], will abide in their own state [of Self] without attending to the world [and without seeking happiness from worldly objects].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2214"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The musk-deer emits a pleasant odour, but not knowing that the odour is coming only from itself, it runs here and there in search of the source of that odour. Similarly, not knowing that all the happiness they enjoy comes only from their own Self, whose very nature is happiness, ignorant people (<em>ajnanis</em>) run after worldly objects in search of happiness. Compare here verse 585 of this work, and pages 36 to 40 of <em>The Path of Sri Ramana –</em> Part One.</p>
<p id = "para-2215"><b>1029.</b> <b>That which is called happiness is only the nature ofSelf; Self is not other than perfect happiness. That which is called happiness alone exists. Knowing that fact and abiding in that state of Self, enjoy bliss eternally.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2216"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Refer to the work <em>Who am I?</em>, in which Sri Bhagavan says, “That which is called happiness is only the nature of Self; happiness and Self are not different. The happiness of Self [<em>atma-sukha</em>] alone exists; that alone is real.”</p>
<p id = "para-2217"><b>31****The Power of Self</b></p>
<p id = "para-2218"><em>(Atma Vala Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-2219"><b>B20. Proclaim thus, “Whoever has conquered the senses by knowledge [<em>jnana</em>], being a knower of Self [<em>atmavid</em>] who abides as existence-consciousness, is the fire of knowledge [<em>jnanagni</em>]; [He is] the wielder of the thunderbolt of knowledge [<em>jnana-vajrayudha</em>]; He, Kala-kalan, is the hero who has killed death.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2220"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The wielder of the thunderbolt (<em>vajrayudha</em>) is Indra, the most powerful of the gods, who is believed by some followers of the <em>karma-kanda</em> (the portion of the <em>Vedas</em> which teaches ritualistic actions for the fulfillment of worldly desires) to be the Supreme Lord of the Universe. Therefore in this verse Sri Bhagavan tells such <em>karma-kandis</em> that the real Indra, the <em>JnanaIndra</em>, is only the <em>Atma-jnani</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2221">The word <em>‘kala’</em> means either ‘death’ or ‘time’, and is a name of Yama, the God of death. <em>Kala-karan</em> means either ‘death to death’ or ‘conqueror of time’, and is a name of Lord Siva, who killed Yama.</p>
<p id = "para-2222">Thus in this verse Sri Bhagavan reveals that the <em>Jnani</em> is not merely an incarnation of any particular God. The <em>Jnani</em> is <em>Jnana</em> itself, and hence He is none other than Indra, Lord Siva and all other Gods. Since the <em>Jnani</em> has conquered the senses, through which the whole universe is projected, He has in truth conquered the whole universe. Therefore, in the entire universe there is no power greater than the power of the <em>Jnani’s</em> Self-abidance.</p>
<p id = "para-2223">The above verse of Sri Bhagavan, which is also included in <em>Ulladu Narpadu –Anubandham</em> as verse 28, summarizes the ideas expressed in the following two verses of Sri Muruganar.</p>
<p id = "para-2224"><b>1030.</b> <b>Only the powerful <em>Jnani</em>, who has conquered the five [senses] by Self-abidance, which blazes forth unobstructed [by even the least <em>pramada</em>], is the wielder of the thunderbolt of <em>Jnana</em> who has destroyed Yama, who will never turn back [empty-handed]; [He is] the sun of <em>Jnana</em>, which destroys [the darkness of] the appearance of [the six inner enemies, namely desire, anger, miserliness, delusion, pride and] jealousy.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2225"><b>1031.</b> <b>Know that He [the <em>Jnani</em>] who, angrily driving it back into the heart [through Self-attention], destroys the cruel Surapadma, the ‘I’ [or ego], who possesses the power of creating and sustaining all the worlds through the six senses, is Kumara [Lord Subrahmanya], who revels in supreme bliss.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2226"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since it is only through the mind that one is able to know the world through the other five senses, the mind is sometimes counted as one among the senses, thus making them six in number.</p>
<p id = "para-2227">The fact that the true <em>Jnani</em>, who has conquered and destroyed the ego, is the embodiment of all the forms of God [<em>Iswara-murtis</em>], is also revealed by Sri Bhagavan in verse 6 of <em>Devikalottaram</em>, “He is the Four-faced One [Brahma], Siva and Vishnu; He is the king of the <em>devas</em> [Indra] and Guha [Lord Subrahmanya]; He alone is the Guru of all <em>devas</em>; He is the great Yogi and the possessor of the wealth of all <em>tapas</em>.”</p>
<p id = "para-2228"><b>32 The Nature of Self</b></p>
<p id = "para-2229"><em>(Atma Swarupa Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-2230"><b>1032.</b> <b>O men who are [wrongly believing] that this body,which is [insentient like] a picture, is ‘I’, can a picture think anything? That which thinks and that which forgets is only the soul. Therefore, that which is called ’I’ is [not the insentient body but] only that [the sentient soul].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2231"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this verse the ego or <em>jiva</em>, the false ‘I’, is referred to as if it were the real ‘I’. Why? Since Sri Bhagavan’s aim at first is only to prove the sentient being is only the <em>jiva</em> or mind which thinks and forgets. He then concludes that the body, which is insentient and which cannot think anything, is therefore not ‘I’. Then in the next verse He reveals the truth that even this mind is not the real ‘I’. Thus the method of teaching adopted by Sri Bhagavan in these two verses is the same as that mentioned in <em>Kaivalya Navanitham</em>, chapter 1, verse 18, namely, “Like showing the crescent moon by first showing some trees on earth, and like showing Arundhati [a small star] by first showing some [larger] stars in the sky ... ”.</p>
<p id = "para-2232"><b>1033.</b> <b>When that body is [thus found to be] different [from‘I’], there must be another soul [or life] having as its body the soul, whose form is ‘I am the body’, shining within that soul. When this is so, except that [other soul], which is the real soul, can there be other souls? Tell me.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2233"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The thinking and forgetting soul mentioned in the previous verse is the <em>jiva</em>, whose form is the thought ‘I am the body’. But since that verse concludes that the body is not ‘I’, the <em>jiva</em> or ego is found to have actually no form at all. In other words, since the <em>jiva</em> is neither the insentient body nor the consciousness ‘I am’, but is only a false link which seemingly comes into existence when these two different things are mistaken to be one and the same, we have to conclude that the <em>jiva</em> has no real existence and that it therefore cannot be ‘I’, the real soul or life. Thus we must accept that there is another soul [another sentient reality] which has been existing all this time within that insentient <em>jiva</em>, activating it and having it as its abode. This other soul [the Self], which has the <em>jiva</em> as its body and which is the consciousness or life that makes that insentient <em>jiva</em> appear as if it were sentient or alive, alone is the real soul. When Self [the real, pure consciousness ‘I am’] is thus found to be the sole reality of the <em>jivas</em> [the unreal, mixed consciousness ‘I am the body’], how can there truly exist any souls other than Self? Thus this verse teaches that except Self, the one and only real soul or life, there never exists any soul at any time or in any place.</p>
<p id = "para-2234"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Refer here to verse 1051.</p>
<p id = "para-2235"><b>1034.</b> <b>The reality which shines fully, without misery andwithout a body not only when the world is known but also when the world is not known [as in sleep], is your real form [<em>nija-swarupa</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2236"><b>1035.</b> <b>Let the world which is known [through the fivesenses] be real or let it be discarded as an imagination of the mind which knows [it], do you not exist there as the form of the knowing consciousness? That, the pure consciousness [‘I am’], alone is the form of Self [<em>atma-swarupa</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2237"><b>1036.</b> <b>The reality which is the mere consciousness [of one’sown existence] that remains when ignorance [of objects] is destroyed along with knowledge [of objects], alone is Self [<em>atma</em>]. In that <em>Brahma-swarupa</em>, which is abundant Self-awareness [<em>prajnana</em>], there is not the least ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>]. Know thus.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2238"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: People generally think that the state of not knowing other things is a state of ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>]. But this is not correct. Indeed, the knowledge of other things is itself ignorance [see <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, verse 13]. Since even during the absence of the so-called knowledge of other things, which is nothing but ignorance, the pure Self-knowledge ‘I am’ is experienced by everyone, this knowledge of one’s own existence is alone the perfect knowledge [<em>purna-jnana</em>]. This knowledge, which is different from other knowledges, is referred to in this verse as ‘the reality which is mere [or empty] consciousness’ [v_etrarivana unmai_], ‘Self’ [<em>atma</em>], ‘Selfawareness’ [<em>prajnana</em>] and <em>‘Brahma-swarupa’</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2239"><b>1037.</b> <b>It [that <em>Brahma-swarupa</em>] is not only that which is devoid of ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>], but is also Self, which is perfect knowledge [<em>sujnana</em>]. If it were not real knowledge [<em>sat-bodha</em>], how could the differences of the intellect be born from it?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2240"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The phrase ‘the differences of the intellect’ [<em>vijnanabheda</em>] means the knowledge of differences [the knowledge of dyads and triads] which shines in the intellect or <em>vijnanamaya-kosa</em> and which is experienced by all <em>jivas</em>. Though this qualified knowledge [<em>visesha jnana</em>] is unreal, the base from which it seemingly rises or is born must be a real knowledge or consciousness. Therefore it is to be concluded that Self [<em>atma</em>], the source of the intellect, is of the very nature of knowledge [<em>jnana</em>]. Refer here to verse 12 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “ ... Know that Self is knowledge, not a void”.</p>
<p id = "para-2241"><b>1038.</b> <b>That knowledge is not a quality [<em>guna</em>] of Self, because the nature of Self is <em>nirguna</em> [devoid of qualities]. [Moreover] Self-knowledge is not an act [of knowing], because [Self is] without doership [<em>akartritva</em>]. [Therefore] knowledge is the very nature [of Self].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2242"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Since Self is the non-dual reality, there is no other thing to know Self, and hence it is Self alone that knows itself. But since Self is by nature without doership and hence actionless, Self’s knowledge of itself is not an act of knowing; Self knows itself not by an act of knowing, but by being itself [see <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em> verse 26, “Being Self is itself knowing Self, because Self is that which is devoid of duality ... ”]. Therefore it follows that the very nature of Self is itself knowledge, though it is a knowledge which is devoid of the act of knowing. That is why Sri Bhagavan says in verse 12 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, “ ... That which knows cannot be [true] knowledge ... ”. The same truth is also expressed by Sri Muruganar in verse 831 of <em>Mey Tava Vilakkam</em>, where he says, “The real ‘I’ is such a knowledge which knows neither other things nor itself”. Since Self-knowledge is non-dual, it is a knowledge which shines without the triad [triputi] – the knower, the act of knowing and the object known – and hence it is quite different from other kinds of knowledge, all of which involve the act of knowing. Refer also to <em>The Path of Sri Ramana –</em> Part Two, appendix 4 (c), p. 236.</p>
<p id = "para-2243"><b>1039.</b> <b>That adjunctless knowledge, which is merely powerful existence, which shines within of its own accord as the indestructible ‘I am’, and which does not depend even in the least upon any other thing, alone is the nature of one’s own unshakeable reality [Self].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2244"><b>1040.</b> <b>How to know one’s own reality, which [as describedin the previous verse] exists as the shining of <em>Jnana</em>, like [one knows] petty sense-objects [second and third persons]? [But] if one peacefully abides in Self, [thereby] destroying the false first person ‘I’ [the ego which rises mixed with adjuncts as ‘I am this, I am so-and-so’], the real first person [Self, the real ‘I’] will shine forth of its own accord.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2245"><b>1041.</b> <b>Among the many groups which are triads [<em>triputis</em> or the three factors of objective knowledge], no factor [<em>puti</em>] can exist leaving Self. However, not even one among those factors is Self. Only that which remains as the base of all those [factors] is the real state of Self.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2246"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The group of three factors, the seer, the act of seeing and the object seen, is a triad [<em>triputi</em>]. ‘I am the seer’, ‘I am seeing’ and ‘these objects are seen by me’ – none of these three knowledges can exist without an ‘I’. But this ‘I’, the seer, is not Self; it is only the ego. Therefore, it is said in this verse that none of the three factors which constitute a triad is Self. Actions or <em>pravrittis</em> such as seeing are not the nature of Self. ‘I am seeing’ is the nature of the ego’s knowledge. The knowledge of one’s own existence, ‘I am’, alone is the nature of Self. If there did not exist the basic knowledge, ‘I am’, the qualified knowledge ‘I am seeing’ could not arise for the ego. Therefore it is said in this verse that none of the factors for a triad can exist leaving Self, and also that, since objective knowledge does not exist for Self, none of those factors are Self.</p>
<p id = "para-2247"><b>1042.</b> <b>One’s own Self, whose greatness is eternality andperfect wholeness is not at all duality [another thing] to be attained.

<p id = "para-2248"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Real <em>yoga</em> is only union with Self, which is not the state of knowing other things but only the state of knowing one’s own existence. Since in order to know a thing we must attend to it, the only path to attaining the real <em>yoga</em> is Self-attention and not attention to any other thing. When by Self-attention one thus attains <em>yoga</em> or union with one’s own Self, it will be found that such Self-attention (the consciousness of one’s own existence) is itself the real form or nature of Self.</p>

By itself, the worship of any of the names and forms of God is not sufficient to enable one to attain Self-realization, and this is why Sri Bhagavan says in this verse, “Which petty God can bestow upon the <em>jiva</em> the life in the divine state of Siva?’. The worship of God in name and form can only purify the mind and thereby lead one indirectly to the path of Self-enquiry.</p>
<p id = "para-2296">From this verse the reader can understand that the real meaning intended by Sri Bhagavan in verse 8 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> when He used the words “<em>peruruvil</em>” is only ‘in name and form’ and not ‘without name and form’.

<p id = "para-2298"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Just as the objects of the world appear during the waking state and disappear during sleep, so visions of God appear at one time and disappear at another time. Therefore, those visions of God have no more reality than the world and the objects in it. But that which always shines [in the form of the Self-awareness ‘I am’] both in waking [when objects are known] and in sleep [when objects are not known] is Self. Only because they do not attend to and realize the ever-shining nature of Self as it is, some aspirants feel happy at one time as if they had seen God and feel distressed at other times as if they had lost that vision of God.

Therefore, since that which was shining in all the three times without changing or disappearing was only our own existence-consciousness, this verse affirms that that existenceconsciousness [<em>sat-chit</em>], which is Self, alone is the supreme God [<em>para-deva</em>] and the real God [<em>nija-deva</em>].</p>

Since all these principles or <em>tattvas</em> are only second or third persons, the non-Self [<em>anatma</em>], one should not waste one’s time in scrutinizing them, but should instead scrutinize Self, the only real principle, through the enquiry ‘Who am I?’</p>

<p id = "para-2310"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The nature of <em>jiva</em> is to think that fear will be removed only when there is some other person with him. But this idea is foolish. How can there be cause for fear in the state of Self, where no other thing exists? Only in a state where there exists something other than oneself is it possible for one either to have desire for that thing or to have fear of it. Therefore, true fearlessness can be attained only in the non-dual state of Self, where no other thing exists.</p>
<p id = "para-2311">To illustrate how fearlessness can be attained only when one attains the state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used to narrate the following story: After Lord Vishnu had killed Hiranya, Hiranya’s son Prahlada was happily ruling the kingdom. But after some time, a fear arose in Prahlada. “Because Lord Vishnu is kind to me, I am living safely. But if one day He becomes angry with me, He will kill me just as He killed my father,” thought Prahlada. Being a great devotee of Lord Vishnu, Prahlada had no one else to turn to, so he prayed to Him. The Lord immediately appeared before Prahlada, who then explained his fear and prayed for the state of fearlessness. “Yes,” said Lord Vishnu, “You are correct. By seeing me like this in name and form, you cannot be free from fear. You must see me within yourself. Only when you thus realize me to be not different from yourself, will you attain the state of fearlessness”. Then the Lord taught him the path of Self-enquiry. When Prahlada followed the Lord’s instructions and realized Self, he attained the state of fearlessness. This story thus illustrates that even God cannot serve as permanent refuge from fear so long as one retains the sense of difference [<em>bheda-buddhi</em>]. Only by attaining the non-dual Self can one become truly and permanently free from fear.</p>

<p id = "para-2317"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The space in a pot [<em>ghatakasa</em>] and the space in a room [<em>mathakasa</em>] appear to be different only because of the limiting adjuncts of the pot and the room, for in reality the space is only one.

Refer to verse 24 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>, where Sri Bhagavan says, “In [their real] nature [which shines] as existence, God and the souls are only one substance [<em>vastu</em>].

<p id = "para-2319"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The only difference between two dolls made of ambrosia, one in the form of a master and the other in the form of a slave, is their names and forms.

<p id = "para-2323"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: A note in the Tamil text states that this verse is addressed to God, and that it concerns the belief of the atheist who believes God does not exist. <em>‘Asattu’</em> means that which does not exist. <em>‘Mey’</em> means the reality. That is to say, ‘How can one who knows that he exists say that God, who is not different from that existence or reality, does not exist?’</p>
<p id = "para-2324"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Sri Bhagavan concludes verse 20 of Ulladu Narpadu by saying, “ ... because Self is not other than God”. Accordingly, the atheist who denies the existence of God is thereby denying the existence of his own Self. Since no one can truly deny his own existence, those who wish to deny the existence of God should first try to enquire and know the true nature of their own existence, ‘What is the truth of my existence? Who am I?’ If they do so, they will automatically come to know the truth of God’s existence. Therefore we should understand that those who realize their own existence as it is, will never deny the existence of God, and that since no one can truly deny his own existence, no one is really an atheist. But who is the real theist will be explained in verse 1084.</p>

<p id = "para-2329"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the world, soul and God all appear, exist and disappear simultaneously, they all have the same degree of reality [<em>sama-satya</em>] as each other. Therefore, if one accepts one’s own existence as a soul or <em>jiva</em>, it amounts to one’s accepting the existence of the other two entities, the world and God. That is why it is concluded in the note to verse 1082 that no one is truly an atheist. Yet who is the real theist? All who say that God exists are not real theists. Only the <em>Jnani</em>, who has realized himself to be the supreme Self, having given up the wrong knowledge that he is an individual or <em>jiva</em>, is fit to be called a real theist [<em>Astika</em>]. Thus the beauty of verse 1082 and 1084 lies in their final conclusion, namely that anyone who cannot deny his own existence is not an atheist, and that anyone who has not realized Self is not a theist.</p>

Is it possible [to attain bliss] by your objective attention? Say no more, O <em>karma-nishtha</em> [one immersed in <em>karma</em>], O you small child.”</p>

<p id = "para-2353"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This chapter deals with the question of whether or not God has a form. So long as one thinks that one has a name and form, the body, one must accept that God also has a name and form. Only after one has lost one’s ego-sense, ‘I am the body’, can one know God as formless. Till then, one should not rise to argue either that God has form or that He has no form.

<p id = "para-2355"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The <em>jiva</em> projects his own <em>vasanas</em>, which lie stored in his <em>chittam</em>, through the five senses and sees them outside as the world of names and forms. Visions of God in name and form are also seen in the same manner. Sri Bhagavan used to explain that even the <em>viswarupa darshan</em> [the vision of the cosmic form of God] shown by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in the Bhagavan Gita was only a projection of Arjuna’s own <em>vasanas</em>. Sri Krishna gave Arjuna divine sight [<em>divya-drishti</em>] to enable him to see in Him the auspicious ideas [<em>bhavanas</em>] about God which Arjuna already had stored in the form of <em>vasanas</em> within his <em>chittam</em>. This <em>divya-drishti</em> was not <em>jnana-drishti</em>, as some commentators have wrongly stated, but was only the ability to project certain auspicious <em>vasanas</em> which existed in a subtle form in his <em>chittam</em> and to see them as gross objects outside. In <em>jnana-drishti</em>, <em>Jnana</em> alone will shine and no names and forms will be seen. What Sri Krishna said was only, “<em>I give you the divine eye</em>” [<em>divyam dadami te chakshuh</em> – XI.8]. Moreover, He said, “<em>See in me whatever else you want to see</em>” [y_ach chanyad drashtum ichchasi_ – XI. 7], and not, “See me as I really am”! What is to be understood here is that Sri Krishna simply enabled Arjuna to project and see in a gross form the past ideas [<em>bhavanas</em>] about the names and forms of God which were already stored within his <em>chittam</em>.</p>

<p id = "para-2357"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: <em>Atma-anusandhana</em>, the state of attention to and abiding as Self, alone is the perfect way of praising God [see verses 730 and B13, where it is said that <em>atma-anusandhana</em> is the supreme devotion to God]. Why? What is the aim of all praises or <em>stotras</em>? Is it not to glorify the real greatness of the Lord? The only way to glorify the greatness of the Lord permanently and perfectly is to make the ego merge into Self so that it will not rise again. That is, since the real greatness of God lies in the fact that He alone exists, and since that perfect state of oneness is marred by the rising of the ego [being seemingly divided into two separate entities, the soul and God], only when one abides in Self and thereby prevents the ego from rising, does the real greatness of God shine in all its glory. Therefore, the perfect way of praising God is only to abide in Self without the least rising of the ego.</p>

<p id = "para-2359"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Though <em>Jnanis</em> praise God in name and form, it should be understood that what they are really praising is only Self, the nameless and formless supreme reality. It should not be thought that their praises are limited to any particular name and form. From this verse it is clear that whenever Sri Bhagavan uses the names ‘Annamalai’ or ‘Arunachala’ in works such as <em>Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam</em>, He is in fact referring only to Self. Similarly, Lord Siva who is praised in the verses of Saivite Saints such as Jnanasambandhar, and Lord Vishnu who is praised by Vaishnavite Saints such as the Azhwars, are only Self itself.</p>

Though in a superficial view those <em>stotras</em> appear to be concerned with many different religions, those who can comprehend with deep insight, will not fail to perceive the common nature of impartiality with which they [the sages] behave devoid of that [concern with any particular religion].</p>

<p id = "para-2362"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The Self-enquiry done with great love by a devotee is nothing but the functioning of the Lord’s Grace within him. Hence it is metaphorically said in this verse that the Lord Himself dances the loving Self-enquiry. The rising of the <em>sphurana</em> ‘I-I’, which enchants and embraces the devotee’s mind, thereby leading it to the Heart, is here likened to the Lord raising His Foot at the climax of His dance. This rising of the <em>sphurana</em> is a new and wonderful experience, and it is here likened to the moon and the sun uniting or being wedded together because the devotee’s mind is a reflected light, like the light of the moon, while the Heart is the original light or consciousness, like the light of the sun, and hence the merging of the mind into the Heart is similar to the moonlight uniting with and merging into the sunlight.</p>

<p id = "para-2369"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The above verse by Sri Muruganar was rewritten by Sri Bhagavan in the form of the following verse, which is also included in <em>Ulladu Narpadu – Anubandham</em> as verse 31.</p>

<p id = "para-2371"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The bodily life of a <em>Jnani</em> appears to be real only in the outlook of others. Thus ignorant people [<em>ajnanis</em>] think, “This <em>Jnani</em> is performing activities here in the waking state”. But since the <em>Jnani</em> is in truth bodiless, He does not know those activities; for Him the body and its activities are completely non-existent. Such is the teaching given in this verse. Just as the traveller who is sleeping in a bullock-cart does not know the movement of the cart, and just as a sleeping child does not know that it is taking food [see verse 1140], so the <em>Jnani</em> does not know the state in which the body, senses and mind are active.</p>
<p id = "para-2372">When the body, senses and mind of a <em>Jnani</em> remain without activities [<em>pravrittis</em>], people think, “This <em>Jnani</em> is in <em>samadhi</em>”. This is similar to the state in which the bullocks remain yoked to the cart but stand without moving. Even this state of <em>samadhi</em> or <em>nishtha</em> is not known to the <em>Jnani</em>; for Him it is completely non-existent.</p>
<p id = "para-2373">When people think, “This <em>Jnani</em> is sleeping”, this state of seeming sleep in which His body, senses and mind appear to be unconscious, is similar to the cart lying with the bullocks unyoked.

<p id = "para-2374">Therefore, these three different states in the life of a <em>Jnani</em> appear to exist only in the wrong outlook of <em>ajnanis</em>, who see the bodiless <em>Jnani</em> as a body.

<p id = "para-2392"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The statement which is made in <em>Sri Ramana Gita</em>, chapter 1, verse 11, and which is reiterated in this present verse, namely that the <em>Jnani</em> does not consider the world either to be unreal or to be other than Himself, has been misinterpreted by some people to support their wrong belief that the world of names and forms is real as such. However, the fact that such an interpretation is wrong is made clear in the previous verse of this work, where it is stated that the dual world-appearance (i.e. the world of names and forms) is non-existent to the <em>Buddha</em> or <em>Jnani</em>, and also in the next two verses of this work, where it is stated that the <em>Jnani</em> knows that consciousness is the sole reality of the world, and that in the state of <em>Jnana</em> or pure consciousness nothing exists except that pure consciousness.</p>
<p id = "para-2393">That is, the <em>Jnani</em> does not experience Himself to be the body, which is a mere name and form, but only to be Self, which is existence-consciousness-bliss (<em>sat-chit-ananda</em>), and hence, according to the principle established in verse 4 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, He does not see the world as names and forms but only as Himself, the nameless and formless pure consciousness or <em>sat-chit-ananda</em> (see <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> verse 18, “ ... to those who have known Self, the reality shines devoid of form as the substratum of the world...”).</p>
<p id = "para-2394">Thus, since the <em>Jnani</em> knows that He, the reality, alone exists, and that the unreal names and forms are completely non-existent, He cannot see the world as something unreal or other than Himself. On the other hand, since the <em>ajnani</em> sees the world as names and forms, it is right and necessary for him to discriminate between the unreal names and forms and the real <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>, and to regard the world of names and forms as an unreal delusion created by the mind, which is itself an unreal and non-existent entity. Refer here to <em>Maharshi’s Gospel</em>, Book Two, chapter 3 (8th ed. p. 60), where Sri Bhagavan says, “There is no alternative for you but to accept the world as unreal, if you are seeking the Truth and the Truth alone”. Refer also to verses 50 and 51 of this work, where Sri Bhagavan says that the statement ‘the world is real’ can be correctly understood only by the <em>Jnani</em> and not by the <em>ajnani</em>.</p>

That is why Sri Bhagavan assures in this verse that by one’s thinking of the <em>Jnani’s</em> form, the true light of Self-knowledge will shine forth from within.

<p id = "para-2436"><b>B22.

<p id = "para-2438">Though a sleeping person’s body is seen to be lying quietly in one place, he may be suffering due to his dreaming, believing that he has climbed a hill and is falling over a precipice. Similarly, though an <em>ajnani’s</em> body is seen to be sitting still for a long time in meditation or <em>samadhi</em>, and though he appears to have given up all activities, since his tendencies towards action [<em>karma-vasanas</em>] have not been destroyed and since he therefore retains the sense of doership, he is in fact one who is doing all kinds of <em>karmas</em> and experiencing their fruits.</p>
<p id = "para-2439"><b>48 The Liberated One</b></p>
<p id = "para-2440"><em>(Jivan-Muktar Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-2441"><b>1135-1136. “Though their doership has been destroyed, is it proper to call those who are wearing a body, who are eating [making a living] by other activities and who are doing actions [<em>karma-bandha</em>] ‘a liberated one’? We also see that, being victims to the allotted <em>karma</em> [i.e. to their <em>prarabdha karma</em>], even those Great Ones suffer, [so how can it be said that they are free from the experience of pleasure and pain, which are the results of action?]” If it be asked thus, [the reply is that] their sufferings are merely according to the outlook [<em>drishti</em>] of the onlookers [the <em>ajnanis</em>]; tell me, do they [the <em>Jivan-muktas</em>] say that they are suffering?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2442"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the <em>ajnani</em> thinks himself to be a body [a separate, finite individual], he cannot but see even the <em>Jnani</em> as a body; however, in His own outlook the <em>Jnani</em> knows Himself to be the Infinite Self, which is bodiless and completely devoid of individuality. Due to their defective outlook [<em>dosha-drishti</em>], people see the <em>Jnani</em> as a doer [<em>karta</em>] of actions and as the experiencer [<em>bhokta</em>] of their fruits, which are allotted as <em>prarabdha</em>. But since the <em>Jnani</em> is like the infinite and indivisible space, which has no separate individuality, He does not feel that He is doing any actions or that He is either enjoying or suffering their fruits. Having transcended the dyad of pleasure and pain, He is both a non-doer [<em>akarta</em>] and a non-experiencer [<em>abhokta</em>]. Thus for the <em>Jnani</em> none of the three <em>karmas</em> [<em>agamya</em>, <em>sanchita</em> and <em>prarabdha</em>] exist even in the least. Refer here to verses 1144 and B23, and to verse 33 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu – Anubandham</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2443">Sri Bhagavan once revealed His own experience by saying, “The radio sings and speaks, but if you open it you will find no one inside. Similarly, my existence is like the space; though this body speaks like the radio, there is no one inside as a doer.”</p>
<p id = "para-2444"><b>1137.</b> <b>When those Great Ones [the <em>jivan-muktas</em>] experience the transcendent reality [Self] alone as their own form [<em>swarupa</em>], these insentient people [the <em>ajnanis</em>, who identify the insentient body as ‘I’] seeing them [the <em>Jivan-muktas</em>] as the form of the suffering body, is only according to the outlook of the onlookers [these <em>ajnanis</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2445"><b>1138.</b> <b>Know that the merit [or <em>punya</em> which results from the good deeds which <em>jivan-muktas</em> may seem to do] goes to those who approach and praise with love [those] liberated Great Ones, who, having lost the sense of doership, live as ordained by God, and that the demerit [or <em>papa</em> which results from the sins which <em>jivan-muktas</em> may seem to do] goes to those who vilify instead of praising them.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2446"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Since the bodily life of a <em>Jivan-mukta</em> is a mere appearance which exists only in the wrong outlook of the <em>ajnani</em>, all the actions of His body, speech and mind are also a mere appearance. Therefore, since such actions do not exist in His outlook, He cannot be affected in any way by their results.</p>
<p id = "para-2447"><b>1139.</b> <b>If it be asked, “If they [the <em>Jivan-muktas</em>] have lost the sense of doership, how can actions [of their body, speech and mind] go on? We do see [such] actions going on”, rest assured that, since [their] inner attachments have died, they have God Himself residing in their heart and doing [all those actions].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2448"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: As mentioned in the note to verse 1136, Sri Bhagavan once compared the body of a <em>Jivan-mukta</em> to a radio, which sings and speaks but which has no one inside it. Just as that which makes the radio sing or speak is the broadcasting station, which is in some distance place, so the doer who is speaking and acting in the body of a <em>Jnani</em> is God Himself.</p>
<p id = "para-2449"><b>1140.</b> <b>The actions of the great <em>Jivan-muktas</em> in the intoxication of Silence, which is devoid of all ‘I’ and ‘mine’, are like children’s eating in very deep sleep when made to sit up and take food.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2450"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Being intoxicated by their blissful state of deep sleep, those children have no sense of doership, ‘I am eating’, and no sense of experiencership, ‘This food is tasty’, and yet they perform the action of eating. Similarly, being intoxicated by their blissful state of Silence, the state of sleepless sleep, <em>Jnanis</em> have no sense of doership or experiencership even though they may seem to perform actions. Just as the child is completely unaware of its eating, so the <em>Jnani</em> is completely unaware of all the actions of His body, speech and mind. Refer here to verses 1105, B21, 1133, B22, 1148. B24 and 1165.</p>
<p id = "para-2451"><b>1141.</b> <b>Just as a coolie carries a burden and happily places itdown at the destination, so also the great knower of reality [<em>mey-jnani</em>] will be happy to place down the burden of this body.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2452"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: A coolie will never feel any attachment in the form of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ towards the burden he is carrying. Similarly, a <em>Jnani</em> will never feel any attachment towards His body either in the form ‘I am this body’ or in the form ‘this body is mine’. Just as a leaf-plate is fit only to be discarded after one has taken food on it, so the body is fit only to be discarded after Self-knowledge – the fruit which is to be gained by living in the body – has been attained. By the death of the body, the <em>Jnani</em> will incur no loss and will feel no sorrow. The purpose of the present verse is only to teach this truth, and it should not be taken to mean either that the <em>Jnani</em> is bound by the body until the time of death, or that He feels the body to be an unwanted burden, or that He is suffering by living in the body.</p>
<p id = "para-2453"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Verse 8 of the appendix to <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai – Urai</em> is included here. In this verse Sri Bhagavan says:</p>
<p id = "para-2454"><b>He who has known Self will discard the body just like [one discards] a leaf after food has been eaten [from it].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2455">In this two-line verse Sri Bhagavan has summarized the idea expressed in a four-line verse in a Tamil work called <em>Prabhulingalila</em>, chapter 12, verse 11, by Sivaprakasa Swamigal. Refer to <em>Letters from Sri Ramanasramam</em>, p. 208, for more details. In the last days of His bodily life, when devotees were praying to Him, “O Bhagavan, you should live in this body for many more years,” Sri Bhagavan used to refer to this verse in order to make them understand that, since there is no further benefit to be gained by living in the body after Self-knowledge has been attained, it is fit only to be discarded.</p>
<p id = "para-2456"><b>1142.</b> <b>Will the wave of the deep ocean allow a small creature which has fallen [into it] and which is on the point of death, to raise up its head? [Likewise] in the face of the full flood of the Silence of true knowledge [<em>mey-jnana-mouna</em>], is it possible for the ego, ‘I am the base and fleshy body’, to rise?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2457"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The experience of a <em>Jivan-mukta</em> is a great surging flood of the Silence of <em>Jnana</em>. In that limitless surge of Silence, the ego can never rise again, and hence it is certain that for a</p>
<p id = "para-2458"><em>Jivan-mukta</em> there will be no rebirth [no re-rising of the ego].</p>
<p id = "para-2459"><b>1143.</b> <b>Can the mind [of the <em>Jnani</em>] which has known the greatness of its own Self, having lost the ‘I’ [the ego, whose form is ‘I am this’], be deluded by the deceptive and delusive appearance [of this unreal world]? Can the perception of the unreal appearance of duality be real in the midst of the wonderful and pure space of <em>turiya</em> [the nameless and formless space of pure consciousness]?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2460"><b>1144.</b> <b>For a <em>jiva</em> who is suffering due to dying and taking birth, the most worthy thing to do and to attain with full love, is [to have] the experience of the great state of <em>Jivan-mukta</em>, having subsided and known [its own true nature], so that the rising [of the ego], which is the coming to life [of the <em>jiva</em>] because of [its] forgetting its own reality [Self], may die.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2461"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The rising of the ego as ‘I am so-and-so’, which happens due to forgetfulness of Self, is the birth of the <em>jiva</em>. So that this <em>jiva</em> may die and so that the unending misery of birth and death may thereby come to an end, the most worthy thing for the <em>jiva</em> to do is to attend to itself with great love and thus know its own true nature [Self], and thereby to subside into its source and attain the experience of <em>Jivan-mukti</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2462">This verse may be read along with verses 500 and 501 in the chapter concerning what is worthy to be done.</p>
<p id = "para-2463"><b>1145.</b> <b>Tell me, when their husband, who is the doer, dies –the sense of doership [<em>kartritva</em>] having been destroyed – instead of the wives, who are his three <em>karmas</em>, becoming widows altogether, can two of them become widows and one of them remain unwidowed?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2464"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The <em>jiva</em> is not only the doer of the <em>karmas</em>, but also the experiencer of their fruits. Therefore, when the <em>jiva</em> is destroyed by Self-knowledge, all the three <em>karmas</em> [<em>agamya</em>, <em>sanchita</em> and <em>prarabdha</em>] will become non-existent, since there is no one remaining either to do or to experience them. Hence for the <em>Jnani</em> there is no <em>karma</em> at all. Thus, when some scriptures say that <em>agamya</em> and <em>sanchita</em> are destroyed and that <em>prarabdha</em> alone will remain for the <em>Jnani</em>, their saying so is to be understood as a mere formality [<em>upachara</em>] and should not be taken to be the actual truth.</p>
<p id = "para-2465">The idea expressed in the above four-line verse by Sri Muruganar, was summarized by Sri Bhagavan in the following two-line verse. Later, when this two-line verse was included in <em>Ulladu Narpadu – Anubandham</em>, Sri Bhagavan added another two lines to it.</p>
<p id = "para-2466"><b>B23. Know that just as no wife will remain unwidowed when the husband dies, all the three <em>karmas</em> will become non-existent when the doer dies.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2467"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: This verse is the last two lines of verse 33 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu – Anubandham</em>. In the first two lines of that verse Sri Bhagavan says, “To say that <em>sanchita</em> and <em>agamya</em> will not adhere to a <em>Jnani</em>, [but] that <em>prarabdha</em> does remain [to be experienced by Him], is a superficial reply to be told to the questions of others”. Refer here to <em>The Path of Sri Ramana -</em> Part One, pp. 66 to 68, for a detailed explanation.</p>
<p id = "para-2468"><b>1146.</b> <b>To the body, which was born because of <em>prarabdha</em>, that <em>prarabdha</em> will never fail [to give fruit]. [But] the <em>Jivan-mukta</em>, who has separated Himself [from the body] by severing the <em>chit-jada-granthi</em>, has transcended <em>prarabdha</em> itself.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2469"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: The tenet of <em>Visishtadvaita</em> that <em>prarabdha</em> will not fail to give fruit even to the <em>Jivan-mukta</em>, is refuted here. How?</p>
<p id = "para-2470">Since He has lost body-consciousness by the severing of the <em>chit-jada-granthi</em>, the activities of His body exist only in the outlook of others.</p>
<p id = "para-2471"><b>1147.</b> <b>“When [it is a fact that] the experience of [<em>prarabdha</em>] <em>karma</em> itself exists as the body, if there is no experience of [<em>prarabdha</em>] <em>karma</em> for someone, [even if he be a <em>Jnani</em>] will it [his body] not die?” – if you ask thus, tell me correctly by whom the gross body is seen?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2472"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Is it seen by the <em>Jnani</em> Himself? Is it not seen only by the <em>ajnanis</em>?</p>
<p id = "para-2473"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The <em>Jnani</em>, who has no experience of <em>prarabdha</em>, does not see a body existing for Himself. Just as one’s dream-body becomes non-existent as soon as one’s sleep comes to an end, so, in the outlook of the <em>Jnani</em>, His body became non-existent as soon as He attained <em>Jnana</em> [that is, as soon as His experience of <em>prarabdha</em> was destroyed]. Thus the body of the <em>Jnani</em> seems to exist only in the outlook of <em>ajnanis</em>, who are themselves completely non-existent in His outlook. Therefore, it is meaningless to say that the body of a <em>Jnani</em> is still living.</p>
<p id = "para-2474"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Verse 9 of the appendix to <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai – Urai</em> is included here. In this verse Sri Bhagavan says:</p>
<p id = "para-2475"><b>“If the dove caught in the hand of the hunter is let free, it will fly away even from the forest [in which it was caught], [will it not?]” If you ask thus, [the reply is that] when the hunter, turning back home, goes away [from the forest leaving the dove]), it [the dove] will remain [in the forest], since even that forest, which was [previously considered by it to be] alien, will be [found to be its] home.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2476">One day a devotee named K. V. Ramachandran composed a two-line verse (<em>kural venba</em>) in which he said, “If the dove caught in the hand of the hunter is let free, it will fly away even from the forest”. Though this verse appears to be an affirmative statement, it was in fact intended to be a question in a metaphorical form. Here ‘the hunter’ means <em>maya</em>, ‘the dove’ means <em>jiva</em>, the letting free of the dove means the liberation of the <em>jiva</em>, and ‘the forest’ means the gross body. Hence the meaning implied by K. V. Ramachandran’s verse is, “If the <em>jiva</em>, which is bound by <em>maya</em>, is liberated, it will at once leave the body [in which it was bound], will it not?”</p>
<p id = "para-2477">Sri Bhagavan gave His answer to this question by taking the same two-line verse and expanding it into a four-line verse (<em>venba</em>). The meaning implied by His answer is as follows, “If you ask thus, the reply is that when, by attending to ‘I’, <em>maya</em> [which is nothing but the mind] disappears, being found to be non-existent, the <em>jiva</em> [who has thereby realized his true nature as Self] will remain in the gross body, since even that body, which was previously considered by the <em>jiva</em> to be alien or other than itself, will be known [through the unbroken experience of <em>Jnana</em>] to be nothing but Self”.</p>
<p id = "para-2478">This implied meaning is made still more explicit in Tamil by the fact that Sri Bhagavan uses the words <em>‘nadi aham’</em>, which means both “Turning back home” and “attending to ‘I’ ”.</p>
<p id = "para-2479">Thus the meaning of Sri Bhagavan’s reply is that there is no rule that the body must die when <em>Jivan-mukta</em> is attained. Moreover, since after Self-realization nothing (neither the body nor the world) can exist as other than the single unbroken Self-consciousness, even the limited knowledge ‘the body is not I’, which existed during the period of <em>sadhana</em>, will be removed, and the unlimited knowledge ‘the body is also I’ will be attained. Verse 17 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> may also be read here.</p>
<p id = "para-2480"><b>1148.</b> <b>One who is blinded by drunkenness does not knowwhether the cloth on his body remains there or has fallen down. [Likewise] the <em>Siddha</em> [i.e. <em>Jnani</em>] who knows [and is immersed in] the form of light [His own Self-consciousness], which is [limitless and subtle like] the space, does not know the connection [the living] or the removal [the death] of the unreal and insentient body.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2481"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: This verse is a translation of a Sanskrit verse in the <em>Bhagavatam (XI-13-36)</em> which Sri Bhagavan sometimes used to quote. The same idea is also expressed by Sri Bhagavan in the following verse. Refer here to <em>Day by Day with Bhagavan</em>, 9-1-46 and 18-1-46 to 21-1-46.</p>
<p id = "para-2482"><b>B24. The body is transitory [and hence unreal]. Whether [due to <em>prarabdha</em>] it is resting or moving, whether due to [<em>prarabdha</em>] <em>karma</em> it is clinging [living] or has left [died], the <em>Siddha</em> who knows Self does not know the body, just as one who is blinded by toddy-intoxication [does not know his] clothes.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2483"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Just because the words “whether it is resting or moving, whether it is living or has died” are used here, we should not conclude that for the <em>Jnani</em> a body actually is born, lives, works and dies. We should understand that for the <em>Jnani</em> there is in truth no such thing as birth, activity and death of the body, and that these seem to exist only in the wrong outlook of the <em>ajnani</em> who sees them.</p>
<p id = "para-2484"><b>1149.</b> <b>The form of the living body of the perfect <em>Jnanamukta</em>, who has destroyed the ego-defect, is like a [burnt] red silk cloth, which remains without losing its appearance even though it has lost its reality, having become ashes.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2485"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: When a red silk cloth is burnt, it retains both its form and its colour, even though its substance has become ashes. Similarly, after the ego has been burnt in the fire of <em>Jnana</em>, the body of the <em>Jnani</em> will appear to remain unchanged and will seemingly continue to live and perform activities, even though His ‘I am the body’ consciousness (<em>dehatma-buddhi</em>) has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p id = "para-2486"><b>1150.</b> <b>Just as only a snake can know the legs of a snake,only a <em>Jnani</em> can know the nature of a <em>Jnani</em>. The nature of a <em>Jnani</em> cannot be known by anyone else correctly but only wrongly [literally, as <em>viparita</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2487"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: Since the knowledge of one who possesses only book-knowledge is a deluded knowledge, he can see the reality only wrongly and not as it is, and hence he cannot clearly know the true nature of a <em>Jnani</em>. Even in the scriptures which give the definition [<em>lakshana</em>] of <em>Jivan-mukti</em>, it is said that <em>Jnanis</em> may appear to be madmen, ghost-possessed people or children, and that it is not possible for ignorant people [<em>ajnanis</em>], in whom the awareness of the world is not lost, to fathom them.</p>

<p id = "para-2489"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The idea expressed in this verse is re-expressed by Sri Bhagavan in His own words in the following verse, which is also included in <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> as verse 31.</p>
<p id = "para-2490"><b>B25. For Him who enjoys the bliss of Self, which has risen on the destruction of himself [the ego], what single thing remains to do? He does not know anything other than Self; [therefore] who can and how to conceive what His state is?</b></p>

Since the knowledge gained through the five senses is a false knowledge, whereas the knowledge of Self alone is the true knowledge, these two kinds of wise men are completely different from each other.</p>
<p id = "para-2500"><b>1156.</b> <b>However keenly one looks into the true scriptures,they will tell one only to scrutinize oneself within oneself [and thereby to know who one really is].

<p id = "para-2501"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The purpose of looking into a mirror is not merely to waste one’s time either in looking at the reflection or in appreciating the mirror; the purpose is only to experience the joy of seeing the beauty of one’s own face. Similarly, the purpose of reading the scriptures is only to experience the true happiness of Self-knowledge. Therefore, as soon as one reads the scriptures, which reveal ‘You yourself are that <em>Brahman’</em>, one should make proper use of that information and should verify the truth of it from one’s own direct experience by scrutinizing and knowing oneself through the enquiry ‘Who am I?’. Refer here to the work <em>Who am I?</em> where Sri Bhagavan says, “Since it is said in all the scriptures that in order to attain liberation one should control [i.e. destroy] the mind, after coming to know that mind-control alone is the final decision of the scriptures, to read scriptures unlimitedly is fruitless” [see verse 141 of this work].</p>
<p id = "para-2502">After engaging oneself in the <em>sadhana</em> of knowing Self, making research in the scriptures is of no use. Scriptures are useful only to turn us towards the path of Self-enquiry, and are of no further use to us during the time when we are engaged in practice or <em>nididhyasana</em>. This is what is meant by Sri Bhagavan in the work <em>Who am I?</em> when He said, “For Rama to know himself to be Rama, is a mirror necessary? ... All that one has learnt will at one time have to be forgotten.”</p>

<p id = "para-2507"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The reason why it is said in verse 1158 that one should leave the scholars and associate instead with those who abide as Self is explained in this verse. Rather than in all the lectures and explanations given by scriptural scholars, in a single word uttered by a <em>Jnani</em>, who [though He may be unlearned] has known the supreme reality, there is more power of authority [the power of the light of Self] to dispel the darkness of ignorance [<em>ajnana</em>] in other <em>jivas</em>.

<p id = "para-2528">Even in the life of Sri Bhagavan there were some people who used to ridicule and find fault with Him.

He is sitting on a sofa supported by soft cushions. He is eating and behaving like us. Is He a <em>Rishi</em>?

Who is able to write it?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2539"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: On 30th September 1937 a devotee named Somasundara Swami requested Sri Bhagavan to write “one letter” [or <em>ezhuttu</em>] in his notebook. Sri Bhagavan graciously replied by writing a two-line verse [<em>kural venba</em>], in which He said, “The one letter [or <em>ezhuttu</em>] is that which always shines of its own accord [or as Self] in the heart! Who is able to write it?” Subsequently when Sri Bhagavan explained the nature of that one letter, Sri Muruganar recorded His explanation in the above verse, in which he incorporated Sir Bhagavan’s <em>kural venba</em> as the last two lines. Later still, Sri Bhagavan translated His <em>kural venba</em> into Sanskrit and Telugu. In the Sanskrit version He said, “The one letter [<em>ekam aksharam</em>] uninterruptedly shines of its own accord in the heart! How can it be written?”. Finally, on 21-9-1940, Sri Bhagavan converted His <em>kural venba</em> into a <em>venba</em> [a four-line verse] by adding two more lines at the beginning, in which He gave the reason why the verse was composed:</p>
<p id = "para-2540"><b>That [which is worthy to be called a] letter [<em>aksharam</em>] is the one letter [or <em>ezhuttu</em>]. You have requested [me] to write that one letter [<em>aksharam</em>] in this book. The one letter, which is imperishable [<em>aksharam</em>], is that which always shines of its own accord [or as Self] in the heart! Who is able to write it?”</b></p>
<p id = "para-2541">The word <em>‘aksharam’</em>, which is used three times by Sri Bhagavan in this verse, means both ‘letter’ and ‘that which is imperishable’, and hence the first sentence may alternatively means, “That which is imperishable [<em>aksharam</em>] is the one letter”.</p>
<p id = "para-2542">The one letter mentioned in this verse is Self itself. Its real form is only Silence [<em>mauna</em>], which is the correct definition of <em>Jnana</em>. The Self-consciousness ‘I-I’ shines transcending light and sound. Since it shines devoid of sound as the mere <em>sphurana</em>, it transcends sound, and thus it transcends language. Moreover, since Self is the self-shining pure consciousness [<em>prajna</em>] which is beyond all kinds of gross and subtle lights, it transcends light, and thus it cannot have the form of a written letter, since all visible forms come within the range of light.</p>
<p id = "para-2543">The first expression of the true consciousness of the supreme reality, Self, is the <em>sphurana</em> ‘I’. The <em>Pranava ‘Om’</em> is only the sound-form of that reality, which rises later as a secondary expression of it. But since that which shines as the reality of the sound ‘<em>Om</em>’ is only Self or ‘I’, Sri Bhagavan sang in verse 13 of <em>Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai</em>, “O Arunachala, reality of ‘Om’, unequalled and unsurpassed! Who can understand you?”, and He used to say that, even prior to ‘<em>Om</em>’, the natural name of the reality is only the consciousness ‘I’, which transcends both sound and light. Refer here to verses 712 and 713 of this work.</p>
<p id = "para-2544">Therefore, since Self, the foremost reality, is one [<em>ekam</em>] and since nothing exists other than it, Sri Bhagavan asks who can write it, and how or where it could be written. Thus, though the devotee who requested Him to write “one letter” in his notebook, Sri Bhagavan taught the whole world that which shines of its own accord in the heart cannot in any way be thought of, spoken or written, and that all one can do is to be it and to know it as it is in the heart.</p>
<p id = "para-2545"><b>1173.</b> <b>If it be asked, “[What is] the [true] divine language,which is the source of all languages, which is real and which possesses the greatest clarity?” That language is only Silence [<em>mauna</em>], which the Lord [Sri Dakshinamurti] who is the embodiment of knowledge [<em>jnana-swarupa</em>] seated at the foot of the banyan tree, taught.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2546"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Verse 10 of the appendix to <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai – Urai</em> should be included here (see note to verse 1027). In this verse Sri Bhagavan says:</p>

<p id = "para-2551"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Sri Muruganar explained that, since the world appears in a moment [<em>kshanika</em>] and disappears in a moment, the word <em>‘kshanika’</em> is used in this verse to denote the world. He also explained that <em>alaya-vijnana</em> is the body-consciousness which continues in the body until the death of the body, that is, that it is the mind, whose form is the ‘I am the body’ sense [<em>dehatma-buddhi</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-2552">The base on which the world and body appear is the mind, the ‘I am the body’ consciousness, and the base on which the mind appears is Self, the pure consciousness, which is Silence. Therefore the indestructible Silence alone is the base for all kinds of knowledge.</p>

<p id = "para-2565"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The aim of a conversation in the form of questions and answers between a Guru and a disciple is to enable the disciple to reach the perfect state of reality.

<p id = "para-2566">The perfect way in which a disciple can ‘question’ and learn from the Guru is to abide in Silence, for the real <em>Sadguru</em> is always ‘answering’ and teaching through the non-dual language of Silence. If the disciple does not abide in the thought-free state of Silence, he cannot correctly understand the <em>Jnana-upadesa</em> taught by the Guru through the language of Silence. Only in that state of Silence will <em>Brahman</em> be truly revealed. “Silence is ever-unceasing eloquence; it is the most perfect language. It is a perennial flow of the language of Grace. Words obstruct the language of Silence [<em>mauna-bhasha</em>]. Oral lectures can never be so eloquent as Silence”, says Sri Bhagavan.

However, do we not nowadays hear that many would-be gurus are advising aspirants, “Go on watching the thoughts of the mind,” as if this were a true method of spiritual practice [<em>jnana-abhyasa</em>]? Since all the thoughts of the mind are nothing but worthless second and third persons, to attend to those thoughts is a useless method which is recommended only by Vedantins who lack true experience. To reveal that this method is of no use for permanently stilling [i.e. destroying] the mind, Sri Bhagavan says in this verse, “The [correct] method is for one to remain silently attending to oneself [the first person] alone, and not for one to attend to the wavering mind [which is a bundle of second and third person objects]”.

<p id = "para-2587">In verse 17 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em> Sri Bhagavan says that if one vigilantly scrutinizes the form of the mind, it will be found that there is no such thing as mind at all. This teaching is misinterpreted by some people to mean that one should attend to or watch the mind, that is, the thoughts pertaining to second and third person objects. However, it should be understood that whenever Sri Bhagavan recommends us to scrutinize the mind, He does not mean that we should attend to thoughts pertaining to second or third persons, but only that we should attend to and scrutinize the first person or ego the root-thought ‘I’. If we thus attend to the thought ‘I’, it will automatically subside and disappear, whereas if we attend to other thoughts, they will multiply and wax in strength. Therefore, in the present verse Sri Bhagavan reveals that if we attend to the thoughts of the wavering mind, we will be slipping down from our natural state of Self-abidance, in which no second or third person can be known.</p>

But merely because Tiruvalluvar said thus, we should not at all come to the conclusion that hearing the prattling speech of one’s own children is the sweetest of all experiences. Since hearing the prattling of children can give one only a transitory pleasure, Sri Bhagavan addresses aspirants who are engaged in the highest spiritual practice and says in this verse that the sweetness of the supreme Silence of the <em>Sadguru</em>, which is ever shining within the heart, is greater and more real than the sweetness of the sound of one’s prattling children.</p>
<p id = "para-2599">However, readers should not conclude from this verse that Tiruvalluvar was one of “those who have not keenly listened to the Lord’s language of Grace, which is the Supreme Word, [which shines forth] when the wandering mind subsides”, but should understand that, since he himself never had any children, he composed that verse only for the sake of householders who seek worldly pleasures.</p>

On the other hand, because of the strength of His Silence, even the great noise of battlefield will remain unknown to a <em>Jnani</em>, who has annihilated the mind by destroying all thoughts or <em>sankalpas</em>.

But the game she plays with these three could not take place if it did not have Self or <em>Brahman</em>, the perfect reality, as its base. The truth that Self ever remains as the base on which <em>Maya</em> plays, is what is indicated by <em>Saktas</em> when they figuratively depict Goddess Kali dancing on the lying body of Lord Siva.

Therefore, just as the screen is seen as it is only when the pictures are not seen, so Self is seen as it is only when the world, soul and God are not seen. Hence, if the world, soul and God are seen, Self will not be seen, and if Self is seen, the world, soul and God will not be seen.

That is, many people see and desire the objects of the world and suffer with the longing to obtain them, while others suffer with the longing to see and attain God. The first kind of people are called worldly people, while the second kind are called devotees of God. However, this verse teaches that, since both these kinds of longing and suffering which people undergo are part of the play of <em>maya</em>, they have no meaning whatsoever and are both merely unreal occurrences resulting from the ignorance of not knowing Self or <em>Brahman</em>, the supreme reality which is the base on which <em>maya</em> thus plays.</p>

Therefore, in this verse Sri Bhagavan teaches that the best and most noble thing for the soul to do is to subside and abide firmly in the state of Silence by knowing and remaining as Self, the unmoving base on which the moving pictures of the world soul and God appear. Since [as stated in verse 1216] one who sees the screen cannot see the pictures, when one thus knows one’s real nature one will not see the pictures of the world, soul and God, and hence one will attain the supreme peace which is devoid of the delusion of being mad after those pictures.</p>

<p id = "para-2647"><b>1223.</b> <b>One’s giving up of everything [by one’s remainingfirmly] without being shaken from the state [of peaceful Self-abidance] on account of slackness [or <em>pramada</em>] in [that state of] peace, which surges because of one’s enquiry into Self, which is the basic consciousness on which everything [the world, soul and God] appears – alone is liberation.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2648"><b>1224.</b> <b>Unless the objective knowledge [the mind whichknows second and third person objects] is completely destroyed, the attachment to the world, which is formed by the senses, which bind the soul, cannot be severed.

<p id = "para-2650"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: “The path which destroys attachment, the enemy” is [as shown in the previous verse] to remain in Self, having given up objective knowledge, in other words, to attend only to Self and not to any second or third person objects. “Merely being” means remaining still with the mere consciousness ‘I am’ and without knowing any other thing.</p>
<p id = "para-2651"><b>1226.</b> <b>The saying, “The attainment of a life of pure Self-consciousness, which shines merely as existence [‘I am’], alone is the state of liberation, which is the light of supreme knowledge [<em>para-jnana</em>]”, is the firm verdict of the Seers of reality, which is the crown of the <em>Vedas</em>.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2652"><b>58 The Supreme Truth</b></p>
<p id = "para-2653"><em>(Paramartha Tiran)</em></p>
<p id = "para-2654"><b>1227.</b> <b>There is no becoming [creation], and there is also nodestruction, the opposite [of creation]; there are no people in bondage, and there are also no people at all doing <em>sadhana</em>; there are no people who seek the highest [i.e. liberation], and there are also no people who have attained liberation. Know that this alone is the supreme truth [<em>paramartha</em>]!</b></p>
<p id = "para-2655"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse is adapted from the Sanksrit <em>sloka</em>, “<em>Na nirodha na cha utpattih na baddhah na cha sadhakah, Na mumukshuh na vai muktah iti esha paramarthata</em>,” which Sri Bhagavan often used to cite, and which is included in the <em>Amritabindu Upanishad [Verse 10]</em>, in the <em>Atma Upanishad [verse</em></p>
<p id = "para-2656"><em>30]</em>, in the <em>Mandukya Karikas [2.32]</em> and in the <em>Vivekachudamani [verse 574]</em>. After seeing this four-line verse composed by Sri Muruganar, Sri Bhagavan expressed the same idea in the following two-line verse.</p>
<p id = "para-2657"><b>B28. There is no becoming [creation], destruction, bondage, desire to sever [bondage], effort [made for liberation] for those who have attained [liberation]. Know that this is the supreme truth [<em>paramartha</em>]!</b></p>
<p id = "para-2658"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Creation, destruction, bondage, the desire to sever bondage, the one who seeks liberation and the one who has attained liberation, all exist only in the outlook of the mind. Hence they all have the same degree of reality [<em>sama-satya</em>] as the mind which knows them. But as Sri Bhagavan reveals in verse 17 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>, when the form of the mind is vigilantly scrutinized it will be found that there is no such thing as mind at all. Therefore, when the mind is thus found to be non-existent, the whole false appearance of creation, destruction, bondage, liberation and so on, will also be found to be completely non-existent. Hence, the absolute truth experienced by a <em>Jnani</em>, who has known Self and who has thereby realized the non-existence of the mind, is only <em>ajata</em> – the truth that there was never was, is or will be any creation, birth or becoming at all.</p>
<p id = "para-2659">The five divine functions [<em>panchakrityas</em>], namely creation, sustenance, destruction, veiling and Grace, are all things which are concerned only with the world, soul and God, which [as revealed in verse 1215] are mere playthings of <em>maya</em>. Therefore, whatever appears as real within the range of these five functions, cannot be the absolute truth. Since bondage, liberation, <em>sadhaka</em>, <em>sadhana</em>, attainment and so on, pertain only to the world, soul and God, they are all unreal. That is to say, since the world, soul and God are the playthings of <em>maya</em>, all knowledges pertaining to them are unreal. [See <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em> verse 13, “Knowledge of multiplicity is ignorance, which is unreal”.] When it is so, only that knowledge which shines transcending <em>maya</em>, and which is a knowledge not of manyness but only of oneness, can be the supreme and absolute truth [<em>paramartha</em>]. The exact nature of that supreme truth can be known only by <em>Jnanis</em>, who firmly abide as that single, all-transcending reality. Their experience alone can be taken to be the absolute truth.</p>
<p id = "para-2660">We should here recall that in verse 100 of this work it is stated that though Sri Bhagavan taught various different doctrines to suit the maturity of each one who came to Him, He revealed that His own experience was only <em>ajata</em>. In order to show that His own experience was also the experience of the ancient <em>Rishis</em> who gave the <em>Upanishads</em>, Sri Bhagavan often used to cite the <em>sloka</em> of which the present verse is a translation.</p>
<p id = "para-2661">The literal meaning of the word <em>‘maya’</em> is <em>‘ma-ya’</em> [that which is not], because when Self-knowledge dawns the activity [<em>vritti</em>] of <em>maya</em>, namely its aforesaid play, will be found to be completely non-existent. Just as the non-existent snake merges into and becomes one with the ever-existing rope as soon as that rope is seen as it is, so the non-existent <em>maya</em> will merge into and become one with the ever-existing and Self-shining Self as soon as that Self is known as it is. Therefore, though <em>maya</em> is not other than <em>Brahman</em> or Self, and though it is said to be beginningless like <em>Brahman</em>, it does have an end, since it is found to be non-existent in the clear light of Self-knowledge. Hence, we [Self], who remain shining even in the state in which <em>maya</em> is thus found to be non-existent, alone are the supreme and absolute truth [<em>paramartha</em>].</p>
<p id = "para-2662">Thus, as the final conclusion of this work, <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai,</em> which is also known as ‘<em>The Light of Supreme Truth’</em> [<em>paramartha dipam</em>], Sri Bhagavan reveals that Self – which always shines without beginning or end and without any change as the single, non-dual existence-consciousness-bliss [<em>sat-chit-ananda</em>] in the form ‘I am’ – alone is the supreme truth [<em>paramartha</em>], and that everything else is a mere play of <em>maya</em> and is therefore completely unreal and non-existent.</p>
<p id = "para-2663">However, this absolute truth cannot be understood by people who are under the sway of <em>maya</em> and are therefore deluded by the defect of ego. Hence, disregarding this supreme truth, they imagine many different goals such as immortalizing the body, heavenizing the earth, going to celestial worlds, attaining powers [<em>siddhis</em>] and so on, and believing such goals to be the supreme truth [<em>paramartha</em>], in the name of <em>yoga</em> or religion they chart out different paths to attain those different goals, they write voluminous books about their own goals and methods, and they become entangled in elaborate arguments about them. However, all such efforts are futile, since they are possible only within the range of the unreal play of <em>maya</em>. Refer here to verse 34 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>, where Sri Bhagavan says that to argue about the nature of the reality, instead of merging within and knowing it as it is, is only ignorance born of <em>maya</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2664"><b>1228.</b> <b>Since it is possible only in [the dim light of] unreality[or ignorance] to make that which exists [appear to be] non-existent and to make that which does not exist [appear to be] that which exists, but impossible [to do so] in the clear [light of] truth, in the certainty which is the truth everything is consciousness [<em>chit</em>].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2665"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: A rope can appear to be a snake only in a dim light, and not in complete darkness or in clear light. Likewise, the ever-existing Self or <em>Brahman</em> can appear to be the non-existent names and forms [the world, soul and God] only in the dim light of ignorance [the mind-light], and not in the complete darkness of sleep or in the clear light of Self-knowledge. Therefore, since that which exists [Self or <em>Brahman</em>] cannot appear to be that which does not exist [the many names and forms] in the clear light of truth, in that clear light it will be realized that whatever appeared to be existent in the state of ignorance is truly nothing but consciousness, which alone is that which truly exists. That is, just as the rope alone ever exists both when it appears to be the non-existent snake and when it is seen as it is, so consciousness alone ever exists both when it appears to be the non-existent names and forms and when it shines as it is.</p>
<p id = "para-2666"><b>1229.</b> <b>Know that all that is told about the soul and God –[such as] that which is the soul that has the bondage of attachment will become God when bondage is removed, just as paddy becomes rice when the husk is removed – is [merely] an imagination of the defective mind [superimposed] on Self, the form of that consciousness.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2667"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Though scriptures at first say, “Just as paddy becomes rice when its husk is removed, so the soul [or <em>jivatma</em>] will become God [<em>paramatma</em>] when its bondage of attachment is removed,” the supreme truth [<em>paramartha</em>] is that there is no soul, God, bondage or liberation at all, and that these are all mere mental imaginations superimposed on Self, which is the sole ever-existing reality.</p>

<p id = "para-2671"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: Since the mind is itself an unreal and non-existent entity, everything which is known by the mind as real or existent, is in fact unreal and non-existent. Hence, if Self were something which could be known by the mind, it would also be unreal, would it not? But since Self is declared by Sages to be that which cannot be known by the mind, it alone is that which truly exists and is real.</p>
<p id = "para-2672"><b>1231. Say, is it possible by the imagination [the mind] to deny the greatness [and reality] of the widely pervading and transcendent Supreme, which completely swallows within itself the defects and differences caused by the crowd of all kinds of knowledge?</b></p>
<p id = "para-2673"><b>1232.</b> <b>Know that the consciousness which always shines inthe heart as the formless and nameless Self, ‘I’, [and which is known] by [one’s] being still without thinking [about anything] as existent or non-existent, alone is the perfect reality.</b></p>

<p id = "para-2675"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: The six doctrines mentioned in this verse are the <em>shad-darsanas</em>, the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, namely the <em>Nyaya</em> school of Gautama, the <em>Vaiseshika</em> school of Kanada, the <em>Sankhya</em> school of Kapila, the <em>Yoga</em> school of Patanjali, the <em>Purva Mimamsa</em> school of Jaimini, and the <em>Vedanta</em> school of Vyasa. The doctrine referred to in this verse as <em>Advaita</em> is the doctrine of <em>Vedanta</em>, whose final conclusion is that the non-dual Self or <em>Brahman</em>, which transcends <em>maya</em>, alone is the ever-existing reality, which has neither beginning or end. On the other hand, the conclusions of the other five schools are all concerned with what is within the range of <em>maya’s</em> play. Therefore, just as <em>maya</em> is said to have no beginning but have an end, these five schools of philosophy are also said to have no beginning but to have an end, since they cannot remain when the truth [Self] is realized and when <em>maya</em> thereby comes to an end. Since all doctrines other than <em>Advaita</em> are thus invalidated when Self-knowledge dawns, <em>Advaita</em> alone is the truth which exists and shines for ever without either beginning or end.</p>
<p id = "para-2676"><b>1234.</b> <b>When known [correctly], that which is said to be realis only one.

<p id = "para-2677"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Though the Sages who revealed the six doctrines (<em>shad-darsanas</em>) of Hinduism and who paved the various different religions in the world, had all realized the non-dual perfect reality, they described it in various ways according to the maturity of the minds of those who came to them.

<p id = "para-2689"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In this chapter [verses 1240 to 1248] Sri Muruganar describes the experience of <em>Jnana</em> which he attained by the Grace of his <em>Sadguru</em>, Sri Ramana.</p>

<p id = "para-2691"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: When the state of supreme truth [<em>paramartha sthiti</em>] is known, one realizes that one had in truth never mistaken oneself to be other than Self, and that consequently one had never been in bondage and had never attained any such thing as liberation.</p>
<p id = "para-2692"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: ‘Abiding in this state, having attained the supreme bliss which is devoid of bondage and liberation...’ is a saying of Sri Bhagavan [in verse 29 of <em>Upadesa Undiyar</em>]. He has also said [in verse 37 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>], “Even the contention held that there is duality during practice and non-duality after attainment, is not true ...”. If the state of supreme truth is known as it is, know that even the feeling of liberation will not exist there; since bondage is ever non-existent, the nature of Self is that which is completely devoid of even the knowledge ‘I am a <em>Mukta’</em>.</p>

However, this true harmony and oneness among religions can prevail only in the state of Silence, and cannot prevail merely due to the intellect thinking ‘All religions are one’, because so long as the intellect exists it cannot but see differences between one religion and another.

<p id = "para-2695"><b><em>Sri Muruganar</em></b>: In truth, harmony [among religions] can exist only in Silence [<em>mauna</em>], and cannot exist [merely] due to the subtlety of the intellect.

The words “having come out in front of me” denote that, though the <em>Jnana-Guru</em> ever exists within [as Self], He took me as His own by appearing in the play of <em>maya</em> with a human physical body like us.

<p id = "para-2723">Cause and effect are a dyad [<em>dvandva</em>], since each one has a meaning only because of the other. The purpose of this verse is to teach that, since the world-appearance is seen as an effect, there must exist a God as the cause of it. Refer also to the first verse of <em>Ulladu Narpadu</em>.</p>
<p id = "para-2724">So long as the world is considered to be an effect, it is necessary to accept that it has a cause. But when Self-knowledge dawns, the world-appearance will be known to be nothing but Self, and the dyad of cause and effect will therefore cease to exist. When the world is thus no longer seen as an effect but only as the uncaused, uncreated and unchanging Self, God will no longer be known as a cause or doer – a separate entity – but will shine as that one undivided Self alone.</p>

<p id = "para-2726"><b>2.</b> <b>O son, the conjurer [<em>indrajalikan</em>] deludes the people of this world without deluding himself, whereas the <em>siddha</em> deludes the people of this world and [at the same time] deludes himself. What a great wonder this is!</b></p>
<p id = "para-2727"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: This verse is an adaptation by Sri Bhagavan of a verse in the <em>Rama Gita</em>, “_Aindrajalikakarta-api bhrantan-bhramayati svayam, Abhrantak eva siddhastu svabhratah bhramayatyah_o”.</p>
<p id = "para-2728">The conjurer who entertains people by performing tricks in the streets knows that his tricks are not real. The <em>siddha</em>, on the other hand, believes that the occult powers [<em>siddhis</em>] which he displays are real, and hence is deluded into thinking that he has really become great. However, his <em>siddhis</em> are in truth no more real than the conjurer’s tricks. Therefore, though the <em>siddha</em> and the conjurer are equal in their art of deluding others, the <em>siddha</em> is inferior to the conjurer because he does not even have the clarity of mind to understand that his powers are unreal.</p>

<p id = "para-2730"><b>3.</b> <b>O my troublesome soul, you do not give rest to me, the stomach, for [even] one <em>nazhigai</em> [twenty-four minutes]; you do not stop eating for one <em>nazhigai</em> in a day; you never know my suffering. It is difficult to live with you.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2731"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: On the day of <em>Chitra-purnima</em> in the Tamil year <em>Sukla</em> [the full-moon day in April-May 1929], a sumptuous feast was served in the Ashram, as a result of which many devotees complained of uneasiness in the stomach. One devotee then quoted a well-known Tamil verse sung by Saint Avaiyar, in which she addresses the stomach and says, “O my troublesome stomach, if you are asked to forgo food for one day, you do not forgo [it]; if you are asked to take [food sufficient] for two days, you do not take [it]; you never know my suffering. It is difficult to live with you.”</p>
<p id = "para-2732">Hearing this, Sri Bhagavan remarked that under the circumstances it was unfair to blame the stomach by quoting Avaiyar’s verse, since it was only the soul or ego which had, for its own satisfaction, stuffed the stomach beyond its capacity. “On the contrary,” said Sri Bhagavan, “it would now be fair for the stomach to complain against the soul,” and so He composed the above stanza. Because Avaiyar lived on alms and often had to starve for days together, she could justly complain against the troubles which the stomach caused her. But through his verse, Sri Bhagavan humorously instructed His disciples that those people who pamper the sense of taste by overeating have no right to complain against the stomach.</p>

<p id = "para-2734"><b>4.</b> <b>O you who make a great celebration [about a socalled birthday], [do you know] what is the [real birthday]? The [real] birthday is only that day when, by scrutinizing ‘Where were we born?’ [that is, “Where or from what did the ego, the false notion “I am this body”, rise?], we are born in the reality [Self], which ever shines without birth or death as the one.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2735"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: In 1912, when devotees first began to celebrate His birthday [<em>Jayanti</em>], Sri Bhagavan composed this verse and the following one.</p>
<p id = "para-2736">In verse 11 of <em>Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham</em> Sri Bhagavan has given an answer to the question, “Who is really born?” Likewise, in this verse He has given an answer to the question, “What is the real birthday?” Identifying the body as ‘I’ due to attachment [<em>dehabhimana</em>] is the birth of the <em>jiva</em>. But this is in fact a false birth, for identifying the body as ‘I’ is the death of our true state. On the other hand, since abiding as Self is the only true life, the attainment of Self-knowledge – which is gained by scrutinizing Self, the source of the ego – alone is our real birth.</p>
<p id = "para-2737">This verse and the next one are to be included in the text after verse 603.</p>
<p id = "para-2738"><b>5.</b> <b>Subsiding [and merging into Self] by knowing oneself – [having discriminated] thus, “Conducting a birthday celebration instead of weeping over [one’s] birth [as ‘I am this body’] at least on [one’s] birthday, is like decorating a corpse” – alone is [true] knowledge [or wisdom].</b></p>
<p id = "para-2739"><b><em>Sadhu Om</em></b>: After revealing in the previous verse that Self-realization alone is the real birth, in this verse Sri Bhagavan teaches that it is ignorance to celebrate one’s false birthday, the day on which one was born in this world as a body. Even though on other days one forgets to lament, “Alas, I am born in this world by identifying this body as ‘I’,” at least on one’s birthday one should remember to lament thus and to repent for that mistake. If instead one celebrates one’s birthday with great pomp, it is like happily decorating a corpse – this body – instead of discarding it with aversion as not ‘I’.</p>

<p id = "para-2741"><b><em>Editor’s note</em></b>: There are eleven verses in this appendix. In Michael’s manuscript verses 6-11 have already been incorporated into the text in the appropriate places. They can be found in the notes to verses 1027, 1127,1141, 1147, 1172, 1173.</p>
<p id = "para-2742"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: The following verse was found among the manuscripts of Sri Muruganar with a note “To be added in <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai</em>”, and was therefore included at the end of the appendix of <em>Guru Vachaka Kovai – Urai</em>. This verse is to be incorporated in the text after verse 592.</p>
<p id = "para-2743"><b>592a. Since death [<em>yama-tattva</em>] comes in the form of forgetfulness [of Self], for the minds of those who [seek to] attain a life of immortality, the five sense objects, whose nature is <em>tamas</em> and which function together, it is more dangerous than [any] deadly, cruel poison.</b></p>
<p id = "para-2744"><b><em>Michael James</em></b>: Knowing objects through any of the five senses, causes one to lose one’s Self-attention, in other words, to forget Self. Such forgetfulness (<em>pramada</em>) or loss of Self-attention is declared by Sages to be death (see verse 394 of this work, and verses 321 to 329 of <em>Vivekachudamani</em>). Therefore, those who are practising Self-enquiry in order to attain the immortal state of Self, should be careful not to allow even the least room in their heart for desire for sense-objects.</p>
