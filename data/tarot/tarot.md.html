<p id = "para-1">&lt; I apologize for the confusion, in the “Career Cross” spread, the first card represents the querent’s current job or career, and it should be placed at the top of the cross.</p>
<p id = "para-2">Instructions:</p>
<p id = "para-3">Shuffle and Cut the deck as you focus on your career question or concern. Draw four cards, and lay them out in the shape of a cross as follows: The first card represents the querent’s current job or career, and should be placed at the top of the cross. The second card represents the querent’s job prospects or potential career paths, and should be placed to the right of the first card. The third card represents the querent’s strengths and abilities that will help them in their career, and should be placed to the left of the first card. The fourth card represents any challenges or obstacles the querent may face in their career, and should be placed at the bottom of the cross. Then, interpret each card in relation to the question or concern, taking into account the position of the card within the spread, and their relation to each other.</p>
<p id = "para-4">It’s worth noting that the spread is a tool to gain insight and understanding, but it’s not a definitive answer. The querent should use their own intuition, knowledge and experience when interpreting the cards.</p>
<h2 id = "link-2">whats the most effective way to shuffle large stiff cards?</h2>
<p id = "para-5">&lt; There are a few different ways to shuffle stiff tarot cards, but the most effective way will depend on your personal preference and what feels comfortable for you. Here are a few methods to consider:</p>
<p id = "para-6">Riffle Shuffle: Hold the deck in your left hand and use your thumb to push the cards towards the base of your fingers. Use your right hand to take about half the cards from the top and hold them in a V shape. Slowly bring the two halves of the deck together, allowing the cards to interlace, or “riffle” together.</p>
<p id = "para-7">Overhand Shuffle: Hold the deck in your left hand and use your right hand to take cards off the top of the deck one at a time, and then drop them back onto the top of the deck. Repeat this process several times, making sure to mix the cards well.</p>
<p id = "para-8">Hindu Shuffle: Hold the deck in your left hand and use your right hand to take a small number of cards from the top of the deck. Then, use your left thumb to push the cards back into the deck. Repeat this process several times, making sure to mix the cards well.</p>

<p id = "para-19">The maelstrom of life can often be difficult to navigate, and it’s not always easy to make decisions based on our own judgment. Tarot cards are a great way of gaining insight into your personal journey in an objective manner; using them, you can explore different aspects of yourself and gain greater understanding about the choices that lie before you.</p>
<p id = "para-20">One popular method for reading tarot cards is through single card spreads (sometimes referred to as one-card draws). In this type of spread, only one card is drawn from the deck – usually from within the Major Arcana or suit corresponding with whatever question being asked – which then gives us a clearer picture about what lies ahead or what needs further exploration.</p>
<p id = "para-21">The 22 major arcana (or “trump”) cards represent major milestones throughout each person’s individual journey - these include such things as death/rebirth cycles, relationships between others &amp; ourselves, personal strengths/weaknesses, etc. When used in combination with other elements such as numerology or astrology they give even more depth &amp; perspective than if just taken at face value alone! Here we will go over the reading for the Strength (XI) card inverted specifically (Pisces, with the intent of present-time):</p>
<p id = "para-22">When Strength (XI) is inverted, it can mean that you are currently struggling with inner strength and resilience. It could also indicate that there’s an external force at work trying to undermine your self-confidence or push you in a direction which doesn’t feel right for yourself. This card encourages us to tap into our internal reserves of courage &amp; compassion so we may find the power within ourselves to break through any obstacles life puts before us! In addition, this card reminds us not to be too hard on ourselves during times of hardship; sometimes having faith in oneself and knowing when/how much support from others might be needed is all one needs for success!</p>
<p id = "para-23">Overall, the reversed Strength (XI) tells us not only to have faith in our own abilities, but also to be aware of the limitations we may face and take whatever steps are necessary to overcome them. With a little perseverance &amp; determination – as well as understanding when/how much help might be needed - it’s possible to reach any goal one sets out for themselves!</p>
