rhyme scheme stretching in latent space (AAAAA ABBB BBCC ?????)


hint: give no care 'bout who you fuck, she know I'm a gangster (en-us)

I know you slime, I know you ain't lackin', you violent
them niggas ran down on yo' homie, now you slidin'
if I don't pick up when you call, you gon' be wildin'
but, I just pray you make it home

ayy, yo, and we still on that get-back
poppin' chains, don't give shit back
backshots get that grip back, go down, get yo' lick back
real niggas don't play with a bad bitch, he ain't finna risk that
soon as I give it to him, he finna get my name on his next tat'

go against me, where your suicide letter?
bitch wanna kill theyself, then I let her
soon as he say it's go-time, I get her
told that bitch, "Bow down," when I met her

you a amateur, ho, I'm in the league
point guard, tongue out, oh, look at the speed
I don't lick the rims on shots, I all net her
jumpshot wetter, NBA better


hint: I want the hood to want me back, look what I done for you (en-us)

I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
and though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
but fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased

I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
the memories recollect just because y'all
celebrate me with respect
the unity we protect is above all

and Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
make sure my kids watch all my interviews
make sure you live out our dreams we produced
keep that genius in your brain on the move

and to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
look for salvation when troubles get real
cause you can't help the world until you help yourself

and I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
and though my physical won't reap the benefits
the energy that carry on emits still


hint: last year I died but this year I won't die (pt-br)

figurinha premiada, brilho no escuro
desde a quebrada avulso
de gorro, alto do morro e os camarada tudo
de peça no forro e os piores impulsos

só eu e Deus sabe o que é num ter nada, ser expulso
ponho linhas no mundo, mas já quis pôr no pulso
sem o torro, nossa vida não vale a de um cachorro, triste
"hoje cedo" não era um hit, era um pedido de socorro

mano, rancor é igual um tumor, envenena a raiz
onde a plateia só deseja ser feliz (ser feliz)
com uma presença aérea
onde a última tendência é depressão com aparência de férias

vovó diz: odiar o diabo é mó boi
difícil é viver no inferno, e vem à tona
que o "memo" império canalha que não te leva a sério
interfere pra te levar à lona


hint: craziest mermaid of the sea (pt-br)

bag de Jesus Christ
salve meu tio, Tião
tô levando minha vida na light
pisciano tranquilão

ela é Mad Max gasolina
teu namorado é mó cuzão
é por isso que ela pega mina
vai sentando com o bundão no chão

o quê que você quer, Regina?
quase que eu te amo, opa
acho que era dopamina
joga esse bundão, cretina

supra, supra hype
me conhece de outras rua
te conheço de outras vida
ela quer me dar alguma coisa, toda linda
nada feito, eu vim de Sepetiba


hint: the things that shaped me, and I don't like to reminisce (en-us)

when you high as me you get highly critiqued
hopped on a beat, purposefully soundin' like nine-three
none quite like me, so haters can S-M-D
when they bitter like black licorice, my life still sweet

I went for the cash grab, crack cash was my math class
fresh white tee, two diamond crosses, look like a hashtag
news is fake, never knew I'd soon relate
to Tom Brady goin' for seven in Tampa Bay

it's that crazy, I ain't never been bothered, that bothered you
you ain't born for this shit, bein' great is too hard for you
that's a hater problem, they try to say it first what you might say about 'em
why you stuck in the past? I stay vibin'

can't just reminisce only, gotta live in the moment
talked my shit at the MOMA with The Weeknd performin'
I'm chosen
got off the big Boeing in Rick Owens
Rick owe us, peep how different it look on us


hint: dark and violent world of power struggles (en-us)

but I tried to stay wide awake coud u might be found dead by the lake
soon as you let me bound to sleep bitch so long ima try to take
play for lite today rite to way why do they try to fight today
i must make them pay twice as much mite as well put the knife away

now I use power tools how bout now why u in the shower
scower u for 6 hours till ill teach you power outlets
how did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
musta just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

positive theres no one fowla down here thats how they found ya
face down in the tub I drown you with powtha down as around ya
such a style that impowers such powers look how you cower
jumped out on you now like I was a jaawa from fuckn star wars

jabba the hut be de ba ba be de ba ba its time to die die
aught to not even botha to scream it dont even matta
amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he raves at ya
not ya everyday damien bathe me holy water

notin like somethin to say so please undastand theres no runnin him
wheres the thrill in a hunt theres no fun in that here I come wit axe
once I act like lumberjack when im hackin him up with that
what was that dial 911 someone is comin in from the back
