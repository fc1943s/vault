<p id = "para-7">I led the frontend development of a customer-facing mortgage simulator and initiated the architecture for a frontend rewrite of an internal mortgage ERP SaaS for a US startup. My team and I worked remotely, conducting Scrum meetings in English across multiple time zones. I implemented the project using functional React and built the interface with Chakra UI. The application featured complex auto-save functionality, secure handling of customer-sensitive information and interactive charts with price calculations. I used Sketch and Figma for screen mockups, which were accessible through InVision. The frontend logic was generated from TypeScript files that modeled the business classes from the C# backend and was documented using Storybook. I also built the applications with full support for dark and light themes and included unit tests using Jest and integration tests with Cypress. For state management, I used Recoil.js and for data fetching I used SWR and Axios. Finally, I organized frontend applications and packages using Lerna in a company-wide monorepo.</p>

I helped rewriting the cash flow generator algorithm in the frontend to support a new type of amortization schedule and developed a bulk data ingestion from an Excel template. I also helped write new e2e testing algorithms for the backend architecture using xUnit and InMemory features of the MassTransit (RabbitMQ) library. The backend stored data in SQL Server with NHibernate and used PostgreSQL, providing data through OData and JSON, consumed by the frontend with DevExpress components. I worked remotely following the Scrum methodology and the CI pipeline was already configured.</p>

<p id = "para-13">Developed the architecture of Ambev’s vehicle fleet manager for the distribution units nationally, the project was a rewrite of an old application that was not supporting the number of simultaneous requests in the morning and late afternoon. I was responsible for the back-end and the DevOps pipelines, which included Docker cluster configuration and monitoring, hosted on-premises with Ambev’s private cloud partner. The architecture lacked elasticity, so we focused on lifecycle management to make sure there were simultaneous clusters of different projects working with proper environment separation. The scripts were initially written in bash, but were later restructured into a Node.js CLI project that interacted with the Docker API through HTTP async requests. The CLI was used on developer machines and by Jenkins to easily deploy the application between different Docker clusters.</p>

I also worked on a small application that parsed scanned images of tests. I followed the Scrum methodology and collaborated with a talented team of frontend designers, hosted on AWS EC2 instances, and stored images on S3.

I was involved in both the front and backend, and we published the app on both the Play and Apple stores. I participated in on-site Scrum meetings, including planning, retrospective, and review meetings with the client, who served as the product owner. The backend was an ASP.NET MVC application serving as a REST API for the mobile app, connecting to a SQL Server database populated by another large project. The frontend was built using AngularJS v1 for structure and OnsenUI with SASS for components, with Apache Cordova wrapping the JS code for responsivity.</p>

<p id = "para-37">On the project I had the opportunity to apply new technologies such as functional programming and learn the basics of deep learning. The project was written in F#, except for the neural network code which was written in Python. The end result was a video representation of any BPM-based song, with fully customizable parameters such as shapes and colors linked to features like volume, pitch, notes, and melodies. The neural network was retrained using transfer learning with a custom dataset from music producer friends. Each layer of the songs (drums, synthesizers, and vocals) were trained separately and transformed into metadata for real-time rendering.</p>
<p id = "para-38">The application was designed to work in real-time, with three microservices working together - an audio listener daemon that listens to the device’s global audio output, a backend that receives commands from the frontend and updates the cluster state using RabbitMQ messages, and a feature dispatcher daemon that renders the visual representation of the detected song in Resolume Arena. The frontend was written in React and F# and used Elmish, a pattern similar to Redux, to manage the shared state. Communication between the frontend and backend was through WebSockets, where the frontend receives the current song position in milliseconds. Every audio layer could be connected to sound features interactively using a component called react-diagrams. The frontend was built to run on browsers and could be built using Electron for optimizations.</p>
